ABRUPTLY, AT 9 : 45 P.M., THE BARRAGE BEGAN FIRST AGAINST THEPALACE GUARD BARRACKS, WHERE A MORTAR AND ARTILLERY ATTACK WENT ON FORHOURS . WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE BIG PUSH ON THE PALACE ITSELF, THEREWAS A DANGER THAT VIETNAMESE AND AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN ANADJACENT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE HIT BY SHELLS . SO, WELLAFTER MIDNIGHT, A FORCE OF 18 TANKS SUPPORTED BY ARMORED CARS AND 600FOOT SOLDIERS WENT THROUGH A COMPLICATED MANEUVER THAT BROUGHT THEMCIRCUITOUSLY TO THE PALACE GROUNDS . AT 4 A.M., FROM SEVERAL SIDESTREETS, THE ATTACKING COLUMNS BEGAN POURING POINT-BLANK FIRE FROMTANKS, CANNONS, MACHINE GUNS AND RIFLES AT THE PROTECTIVE WALLS . BACKCAME A MURDEROUS COUNTERFIRE, EVERYTHING DIEM'S DEFENDERS HAD LEFT .FIRST ONE DIEM TANK CAUGHT FIRE AND EXPLODED IN A TOWER OF SMOKE ANDFLAME . THEN ANOTHER WAS KNOCKED OUT OF ACTION . TWO OF THE REBELS'TANKS WERE ALSO DESTROYED . A CHORUS OF CHEERS . WITH HUGE HOLES NOWGAPING IN THE FENCES, AND THE DEFENDERS SCATTERING INSIDE THE GROUNDS,THE WAY WAS CLEAR FOR THE FINAL PUSH . THEN SUDDENLY, AT 6 : 15 A.M.,EVERYTHING FELL SILENT AGAIN . A REBEL GENERAL, WHO THROUGHOUT THEBATTLE HAD BEEN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH DIEM AND NHU BY TELEPHONE, HADCALLED FOR A FIVE-MINUTE GRACE PERIOD TO ALLOW THE BESIEGED PRESIDENTAND HIS PARTY TO EMERGE . BUT NO ONE CAME OUT, AND THE CANNON FIRINGRESUMED, SMASHING WINDOWS, SPLINTERING DOORS, KNOCKING CHUNKS OFF THEPALACE WALLS . THE RIFLEMEN, BELLYFLAT ON THE GROUND, SNIPED HAPPILY ATDIEM'S LAST-DITCH SUPPORTERS . THE BATTLE WAS CLEARLY OVER, AND 17MINUTES LATER, BY DAWN'S FIRST LIGHT, REPORTED TIME CORRESPONDENTMURRAY GART, " I COULD SEE A WHITE FLAG BEING WAVED FROM A FIRST-FLOORWINDOW ON THE PALACE'S SOUTHWEST CORNER . BUT THERE WAS MORE SHOOTINGFROM THE PALACE . THEN THE WHITE FLAG WAVED AGAIN AND FIRING STOPPED .AT FIRST CAUTIOUSLY, THEN FREELY, THE CAMOUFLAGE-SUITED REBELS BEGAN TOSTAND UP, AND A CHORUS OF CHEERS WELLED UP FROM THE STREETS .WESTERN-STYLE, THEY FIRED THEIR GUNS IN THE AIR, AND RUSHED INTO THESIEVED FORTRESS . " AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORT, THE REBEL SOLDIERS DECIDEDTHAT A LITTLE LOOTING WAS IN ORDER . MERRILY, THEY RAN FROM ROOM TOROOM, RIPPING DOWN CURTAINS FOR SOUVENIRS, GRABBING PIECES OF CHINA .ONE SOLDIER GRABBED A CALENDAR THAT BORE DIEM'S PICTURE, STUFFED IT INHIS SHIRT . ANOTHER MADE OFF WITH A TWO-FOOT JAPANESE DOLL THAT HEHUGGED FONDLY TO HIS BREAST .THE OFFICIAL STORY . FORGOTTEN FOR THE MOMENT WERE DIEM ANDNHU . A FEW HOURS LATER, THE UGLY FACTS BEGAN TO EMERGE . FIRST, THEREWAS THE OFFICIAL STORY . A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITARY JUNTA ANNOUNCEDTHAT THE PAIR HAD SLIPPED OUT OF REBEL HANDS DURING THE CEASE-FIRE,BOARDED A DEPARTING TRUCK WHILE WOUNDED WERE BEING REMOVED, AND SOMEHOWREACHED A CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE CHINESE QUARTER OF SUBURBAN CHOLON .THERE, ACCORDING TO THE STORY, BOTH KILLED THEMSELVES AT 10 : 45 A.M .IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INCREDIBLE END FOR SUCH DEVOUT ADHERENTS OF ROMANCATHOLICISM, WHICH STERNLY CONDEMNS SUICIDE . BUT, IN FACT, THEPRESIDENT AND HIS BROTHER WERE OBVIOUSLY MURDERED . ACCORDING TO ONEVERSION, DIEM AND NHU, SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT ABROAD BY PLANE ; BUT,INSTEAD, THEY ESCAPED FROM THE PALACE, WERE FOUND N THE CHOLON CHURCHBY A TROOP OF SOLDIERS WHO ARRESTED THE PAIR AND DROVE THEM OFF IN ANARMORED CAR TOWARD MILITARY HEADQUARTERS . ON THE WAY, AN ORDER WASGIVEN TO KILL THEM . WHEN THE ARMORED CAR ARRIVED AT HEADQUARTERS, BOTHMEN WERE DEAD . " UNOFFICIAL " PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWED DIEM'S BULLET-RIDDLEDBODY LYING NEXT TO A PERSONNEL CARRIER, WITH A SOLDIER LEANING OVER HIM. A PICTURE OF NHU SHOWED HIM ON A STRETCHER, HIS BODY MARKED BYBRUISES . ACCORDING TO THE SAME REPORT, HE HAD BEEN STABBED TO DEATH .AGAIN THE ACCUSING VOICE OF MME . NHU WAS HEARD FROM LOS ANGELES : "ANY CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST THE NGO FAMILY CANNOT BE HIDDEN UNDER THELABEL OF SUICIDE . I AFFIRM THAT SUICIDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDEREDINCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR RELIGION . " SHE ALSO WORRIED OVER THE FATE OFHER THREE YOUNG CHILDREN, 4, 11 AND 15, BUT REPORTS FROM SAIGONSUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE SAFE . SHE ADDED AMID SOBS : " IF REALLY MYFAMILY HAS BEEN TREACHEROUSLY KILLED WITH EITHER THE OFFICIAL ORUNOFFICIAL BLESSING OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, I CAN PREDICT TO YOUALL THAT THE STORY IN SOUTH VIET NAM IS ONLY AT ITS BEGINNING . " THETRUNG SISTERS . THE REPORTS OF DIEM'S MURDER THAT SWEPT THROUGH SAIGONLEFT A COLD CHILL AMONG EVEN THE BITTEREST OF HIS ENEMIES . BUT FOR AWHILE NOTHING COULD COOL THE EXULTANT CROWDS IN SAIGON . BUDDHISTMONKS, QUICKLY RELEASED FROM JAIL BY THE REVOLUTIONARY REGIME, JOINEDTHE THRONGS . SHOUTING STUDENTS TURNED THE TOWN ON END . THE MOBSMASHED BOOKSTORES THAT HAD BEEN OWNED BY DIEM'S BROTHER, BISHOP NGODINH THUC, AND BY MADAME NHU . ANOTHER CROWD TOPPLED AND BROKE UP THESTATUE OF VIET NAM'S REVEREND TRUNG SISTERS, STALWART VIETNAMESEHEROINES WHO FOUGHT CHINESE OVERLORDS IN THE 1ST CENTURY A.D . ; THEIRMONUMENT HAD BEEN SPONSORED BY MADAME NHU . AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, ASHOUTING ANTI-DIEM CROWD SACKED THE HALL . THEN CARRIED DIEM'S PORTRAITONTO THE FRONT STEPS AND SHREDDED IT . AT FIRST, THE SOLDIERS OF THEMILITARY JUNTA LET THE EXCITEMENT RUN ITS COURSE, THEN TROOPS NUDGEDTHEMOBS OFF MAIN THOROUGHFARES, URGING THEM TO QUIET DOWN . THEY OBVIOUSLYHAD ORDERS FROM THE NATION'S NEW BOSS,DUONG VAN MINH, TO AVOID THE KINDOF TOUGH MEASURES THAT MIGHT MAKE ENEMIES FOR HIS REGIME .ORIENTAL GULLIVER . EIGHT YEARS AGO, GENERALDUONG VAN MINH MADE A TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO SAIGON TO THE CHEERS OF HISCOUNTRYMEN . MINH'S TROOPS HAD HUNTED DOWN THE LAST GUERRILLA FORCES OFTHE DREADED BINH XUYEN BANDITS, A SORT OF ORIENTAL COSA NOSTRA THATPILLAGED THE COUNTRYSIDE AND CONTROLLED VICE IN SAIGON . SOMETIMES ITWAS KNOWN AS " THE WHOREHOUSE SECT . " SO MOVED WAS PRESIDENT NGO DINHDIEM BY MINH'S VICTORY THAT HE KISSED HIS GENERAL ON BOTH CHEEKS . IFSHEER HEFT COULD HELP HIM RUN SOUTH VIET NAM, BIG MINH WOULD HAVE NOPROBLEM . A GULLIVER AMONG HIS COUNTRY'S LILLIPUTIANS, HE STANDS JUSTUNDER 6 FT . AND WEIGHS AROUND 200 LBS., HAS A PRONOUNCED SLOUCH CAUSEDFROM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO STOOP OVER TO HEAR HIS COUNTRYMEN . AMERICANMILITARY ADVISERS NICKNAMED HIM BIG TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM ASMALLER-STATURED FELLOW OFFICER WHO IS NOT RELATED TO HIM, LIEUT .GENERAL TRAN VAN ( " LITTLE " ) MINH . VIETNAMESE GOOD-NATUREDLY CALLMINH " BEO, " OR FAT BOY . PRISON TO PRISON .

HE AND SEVERALOTHER PRISONERS WERE PUT IN A CROWDED, REEKING CELL WITH NEITHER LIGHTNOR TOILET, ANKLEDEEP IN HUMAN EXCREMENT . MINH " ALMOST WENT CRAZY, "WAS FREED AFTER THREE MONTHS, THANKS TO A FELLOW PRISONER WHO WASRELEASED BEFORE MINH AND INTERVENED ON HIS BEHALF WITH THE FRENCHCOMMANDANT . THE FRIEND : NGUYEN NGOC THO, DIEM'S VICE PRESIDENT ANDTHE MILITARY JUNTA'S CHOICE LAST WEEK FOR PREMIER . ALTHOUGH MINH ISUNIVERSALLY DEEMED ANTI-COMMUNIST AND PRO-WEST, THE EXPERIENCE IN JAILHEIGHTENED HIS NATIONALISM . HOWEVER, AFTER HIS RELEASE, HE ACCEPTED APROMOTION TO 1ST LIEUTENANT IN THE FRENCH FORCES, SPENT FOUR YEARSATTACHED TO THE PUPPET REGIME OF EMPEROR BAO DAI .IN 1952, WITH INDEPENDENCE ONLY TWO YEARS AWAY, MINHTRANSFERRED TO THE NEWLY FORMED VIETNAMESE ARMY WITH THE GRADE OF MAJOR.

ONCE, WITHOUTSO MUCH AS ADVISING THE AREA COMMANDER, THEPRESIDENT'S BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU, ORDERED AN ENTIRE BATTALIONTRANSFERRED 80 MILES FROM CANTHO TO SAIGON . MINH PROTESTED PRIVATELY: " GENERALS DO NOT HAVE POWER OF COMMAND, THEREFORE I DO NOT COMMAND. " HE WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT IN THE WARAGAINST THE VIET CONG, BUT HE TOOK NO PART IN THE ABORTIVE 1960 COUP .IN THE END, HOWEVER, MINH SUFFERED FOR HIS VIEWS, WHICH ULTIMATELYREACHED THE PALACE . LAST YEAR, EVEN THOUGH MINH WAS BEING PUSHEDVIGOROUSLY BY GENERAL PAUL D . HARKINS, HIS FIELD OPERATIONS COMMANDWAS ABOLISHED, AND MINH WAS ASSIGNED AS " MILITARY ADVISER " TO THEPRESIDENT A MEANINGLESS POST IN WHICH HE WAS UNDER DIEM'S SURVEILLANCETALK WITH THE PENTAGON .

KNOWING THAT HE WAS SUSPECT, MINHTOOK CARE NOT TO IMPLICATE HIMSELF ; AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO, HESHOWED UP WITH DIEM AT A PALACE CEREMONY . BUT WITHIN THE PAST MONTH,MINH PARTICIPATED IN AN AFTERNOON'S TALK WITH A VISITING PENTAGONOFFICIAL IN WHICH THE POSSIBILITIES OF A COUP WERE DISCUSSED . THE FATBOY SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO LEAD IT, IF IT CAME, BECAUSEHE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A WEAK ADMINISTRATOR . MINH EVIDENTLY FOUND HISADMINISTRATOR IN ARISTOCRATIC, FRENCH-EDUCATED LIEUT . GENERAL TRAN VANDON, 46, ACTING CHIEF OF THE JOINT GENERAL STAFF, CO-LEADER OF THECOUP, AND THE SHARPEST STAFF OFFICER IN SOUTH VIET NAM .
