SOUTH AFRICA UNHAPPY APART PRIME MINISTER HENDRIK VERWOERD'SGRANDIOSE SCHEME TO TRANSPLANT MOST OF SOUTH AFRICA'S 11 MILLIONNATIVES INTO NINE BACK-COUNTRY, ALL-BLACK BANTUSTANS WAS SUPPOSED TOPUT AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S RACIAL UNREST . INSTEAD, IT HAS ONLYINCREASED THE DANGEROUS TENSION BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE . THE FIRSTBANTUSTAN ON VERWOERD'S LIST WAS THE TRANSKEI, A DENMARK-SIZE (16,500SQ . MI.) AREA OF ERODED FARM LAND ON THE INDIAN OCEAN . NOBODY KNOWSTHE TROUBLES IT HAS SEEN . EVER SINCE AFRICANS WENT ON A RAMPAGE THEREMORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, MURDERING THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDPICKED TRIBALCHIEFS AND SETTING FIRE TO ENTIRE VILLAGES, MOBILE POLICE PATROLS ARMEDWITH STEN GUNS, ARMORED CARS, AND HELICOPTER SPOTTER PLANES HAVE HAD TOSTAY ON DUTY IN PARTS OF THE TRANSKEI . FORTNIGHT AGO, A WHITE FAMILYOF FOUR WERE CAPRICIOUSLY HACKED TO DEATH WITH PANGAS AS THEY STUMBLEDDOWN THE STEPS OF THEIR BURNING TRAILER, SET AFIRE WHILE PARKED ON AROAD ONLY 30 MILES FROM THE TRANSKEI'S CAPITAL OF UMTATA . LAST WEEK,AS THE PARLIAMENT IN CAPE TOWN PREPARED TO DEBATE A BILL LEGALLYESTABLISHING THE TRANSKEI BANTUSTAN CERTAIN TO PASS THE NATIONALISTPARTY-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE, PROBABLY BY JUNE THERE WAS MORE TROUBLE .THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO MAKE KAIZER MATANZIMA, A MISSION-EDUCATED TEMBUCHIEF, THE CHIEF MINISTER OF THE NEW TRANSKEI GOVERNMENT . THEBODYGUARD OF A HEADMAN SERVING MATANZIMA GOT INTO A TRIBAL FIGHT WITH40 WARRIORS ARMED WITH SPEARS AND AXES . MATANZIMA QUICKLY MUSTERED 500MEN TO CRUSH THE REVOLT, AND SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE STOOD BY WITH ATRUCKLOAD OF MEN AND A HELICOPTER . THE REBELS FLED INTO THE HILLS .POLICE BLAMED THE TRAILER MURDERS AND THE TRIBAL OUTBREAK ON THEINCREASING INFLUENCE OF POQO (PRONOUNCED PAW-KAW), AN AFRICAN TERRORISTSOCIETY WHOSE MEMBERS, LIKE KENYA'S NOTORIOUS MAU MAU, TAKE SECRETOATHS AND ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY WITCH DOCTORS . POQO FANATICSRECENTLY TRIED TO ASSASSINATE MATANZIMA BECAUSE HE FRANKLY FAVORSAPARTHEID AS " THE BEST SOLUTION " FOR SOUTH AFRICA'S RACIAL TROUBLES .MATANZIMA'S POWERS TO GOVERN THE TRANSKEI'S 1,400,000 BLACKS, 15,000 TO20,000 WHITES, AND 14,000 COLOREDS WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED . ALLMEASURES PASSED BY THE LOCAL LEGISLATURE OF TRIBAL CHIEFS AND ELECTEDREPRESENTATIVES ARE SUBJECT TO VETO BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ; CAPETOWN STILL WILL CONTROL JUSTICE AND INTERNAL SECURITY . MONEY TOIMPROVE THE BARREN REGION WILL BE LACKING . VERWOERD HAS PROMISED ANANNUAL BUDGET SUBSIDY OF $30 MILLION, BUT THIS FALLS FAR SHORT OFMEETING THE NEED FOR HOUSING, SCHOOLS, LAND RECLAMATION, ESTABLISHINGNEW INDUSTRY . IN ADDITION, MATANZIMA FACES POWERFUL POLITICALOPPOSITION FROM ANOTHER TEMBU CHIEF, SABATA DALINDYEBO, WHO DOES NOTLIKE THE BANTUSTAN IDEA AT ALL . DALINDYEBO DEMANDS MULTIRACIALPOLITICAL RULE " IN WHICH THE COLOR OF A MAN'S SKIN PLAYS NO PART INHIS CIVIL RIGHTS . BY ACCEPTING SELF-GOVERNMENT, " HE WARNS, " WE FEARWE WILL BE ENCLOSING OURSELVES IN A PIGSTY .
