LUXEMBOURG MILLENNIUM IN CAMELOT ON AN APRIL DAY IN 963, COUNTSIGFROI, A WAGNERIAN WARRIOR FROM THE ARDENNES, RAISED HIS BANNER OVERA FORTRESS ON A FORMIDABLE ROCK ABOVE THE ALZETTE RIVER IN THE EASTERNFRANKISH EMPIRE . THOUGH SIGFROI'S WIFE SOON VANISHED SHE TURNED OUT TOBE A WATER NYMPH AND HIS FORTRESS CRUMBLED, THE FIEF HE FOUNDED PROVEDAS DURABLE AS IT IS DIMINUTIVE . IT IS FORMALLY KNOWN TODAY AS THEGRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG AND, THOUGH INTERNATIONAL SURVEYS OFTEN OMITITS STATISTICS ENTIRELY, IT IS A THRIVING CHARTER MEMBER OF THEEUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND THE COMMON MARKET, AS WELL AS THESMALLEST COUNTRY IN THE UNITED NATIONS, IN WHOSE BEHALF IT SENT ANARMED AND EAGER PLATOON TO KOREA IN 1951 . LAST WEEK, AS THEY MARKEDTHEIR COUNTRY'S 1,000TH ANNIVERSARY, THE SOLID, EASYGOINGLUXEMBOURGEOIS LOOKED FORWARD TO A LONG SUMMER OF LOW-KEY CELEBRATION,INCLUDING A DOG SHOW, ENDLESS WINE FESTIVALS, AN INTERNATIONAL STAMPEXPOSITION, AND A VISIT BY TWO PLANELOADS OF KINFOLK FROM CHICAGO,WHICH IS SAID TO BOAST MORE LUXEMBOURGEOIS THAN LUXEMBOURG (POP .320,000). THE MYSTERY IS WHY THEY EVER LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE . DIAL219-61 . THE GRAND DUCHY TODAY IS A SORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CAMELOT . ITBOASTS 130 CASTLES (BUT NO UNIVERSITY), PRISTINE FORESTS WHERE WILDBOAR ARE STILL HUNTED, CRYSTALLINE RIVERS THAT TEEM WITH CRAYFISH,TROUT AND, OF COURSE, WATER NYMPHS . THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS, WHO AREWALKING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THEIR CUISINE (FAMED SPECIALTIES : THRUSHPIE AND PARTRIDGE CANAPE), BRAG THAT IT IS " FRENCH IN QUALITY, GERMANIN QUANTITY . " IN OTHER RESPECTS AS WELL, THEY CLAIM TO HAVE EUROPE'SHIGHEST LIVING STANDARDS . THERE IS NEITHER UNEMPLOYMENT NOR SLUMS ;ILLITERACY WAS BANISHED IN 1847, AND THE DUCHY'S BOOMING STEEL INDUSTRYIS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRODUCTIVE . " LUXEMBOURG, " ITS CITIZENSSAY WITH SATISFACTION, " BELONGS TO THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS . " POLITICALLY,LUXEMBOURG IS A FAMILYSTYLE DEMOCRACY IN WHICH STREET CLEANERS GREETTHE PRIME MINISTER BY HIS FIRST NAME . IF A CITIZEN GETS MAD AT THEGOVERNMENT, HE HAS ONLY TO DIAL 219-61 TO HEAR A TELEPHONE OPERATORREPLY, " THE GOVERNMENT, " AND DIRECT HIM PROMPTLY TO THE APPROPRIATEOFFICIAL . FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE, VIRTUALLY EVERY MEMBER OF THE CABINETRUNS AT LEAST TWO MINISTRIES . PREMIER PIERRE WERNER, 49, WHO IS ALSOMINISTER OF FINANCE, IS A GENIAL, TIRELESS CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST WHOBUSTLES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN AN ANCIENT OFFICIAL BUICK AS CONCERNEDLYAS IF THE GRAND DUCHY ALL 999 SQUARE MILES OF IT WERE ABOUT TO MELTAWAY ALTOGETHER . A LOT TO OFFER . ACTUALLY, POLITICAL CRISES ARE FEWAND FAR BETWEEN IN PLACID LUXEMBOURG . THROUGH TACTFUL TREATMENT OFMINORITIES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS AVOIDED THE FATE OF NEIGHBORING BELGIUM,WHERE BITTER ANTAGONISMS BETWEEN FLEMISH AND FRENCH-SPEAKING CITIZENSARE A CONSTANT THREAT TO STABILITY . THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS, WHO SPEAKFRENCH, GERMAN AND A GOBBLEDYDEUTSCH CALLED MOSEL-FRANKISCH, DO NOTEVEN HAVE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE . THEY ARE 96.9 PER CENT CATHOLIC, BUTTHE GOVERNMENT PAYS THE SALARIES OF THE COUNTRY'S SOLE RABBI AND ITSONLY PROTESTANT MINISTER . EVEN THE COUNTRY'S FEW COMMUNISTS PROFESSLOYALTY TO THE ROYAL FAMILY . TITULAR HEAD OF STATE SINCE 1919 HAS BEENTHE HANDSOME, HIGHLY ESTEEMED GRAND DUCHESS CHARLOTTE, 67, WHO LATERTHIS MONTH WILL PAY HER FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE U.S . SINCE SHEESCAPED IN WORLD WAR II TO HEAD HER GOVERNMENT IN EXILE . INDEED,THOUGH THEY PUT UP A HEROIC RESISTANCE AGAINST THE GERMANS IN TWO WORLDWARS, IN PEACETIME THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS KEEP TO THEMSELVES AS A MATTER OFPRINCIPLE . SOME WESTERN DIPLOMATS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COUNTRY PLAY AMORE ASSERTIVE ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS . " THEY HAVE A LOT TO OFFER, "ARGUES ONE . " INTERNATIONALLY, LUXEMBOURG IS THE VOICE OF 20TH CENTURYEUROPEANISM, THE VOICE OF REASON IN THE COMMON MARKET, NATO AND THE U.N. BUT IT IS TOO MODEST . " IN FACT ONE OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'SUNDERLYING REASONS FOR INVITING THE GRAND DUCHESS TO WASHINGTON IS TOSUGGEST THAT LUXEMBOURG SHOULD USE ITS MODERATING INFLUENCE MOREREADILY . BUT THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS ARE NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS ./ WHEN CATS FIGHT, " THEY EXPLAIN, " KITTENS SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE WAY. /MANY ALSO EMIGRATED TO NEW ENGLAND, NOTABLY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'SMATERNAL ANCESTORS, THE DELANOS (ORIGINALLY DELANOIS), WHOSE OLDCASTLE IN NORTHERN LUXEMBOURG NOW HOUSES A FIRST-CLASS HOTEL .
