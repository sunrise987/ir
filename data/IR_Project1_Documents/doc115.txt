MIDDLE EAST SO NEAR, YET SO FAR AS JUBILANT DELEGATIONSDASHED BETLEEN BAGHDAD, DAMASCUS AND CAIRO LAST WEEK, THE ARAB WORLDWAS AWASH WITH JOY . CROWDS SWARMED IN THE STREETS CHANTING THE SLOGAN,/ UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM ! " IN CAIRO AND DAMASCUS, MOBS SHOUTED,/ NASSER ! NASSER ! UNION TOMORROW ! " IRAQ'S DEPUTY PREMIER ALISALEH SAADI CRIED, " THE ARAB WORLD WILL NOW CERTAINLY UNITE . THIS ISAN OLD ASPIRATION . WHAT IS NEW IS THAT IT HAS NOW BECOME POSSIBLE . /DOUBLE PATH . ; THE URGE TO MERGE BROUGHT SYRIAN AND IRAQI LEADERSFLYING TO CAIRO FOR 15 HOURS OF TALKS WITH EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMALABDEL NASSER, THE CHIEF BENEFICIARY OF THE DOWNFALL OF ANTI-NASSERREGIMES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . BUT NASSER HAD CONTRIBUTED LITTLE TO THEVICTORIES THAT WERE ACTUALLY WON IN BOTH COUNTRIES BY A COALITION OFNASSERITE ARMY OFFICER AND POLITICIANS OF THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE)PARTY, WHICH HAS LONG PROMOTED THE IDEAL OF WAHADI ARABIYA (ARABONENESS) . THOUGH BOTH GROUPS HAVE THE SAME GOAL OF UNITY, EACHPROPOSES A SEPARATE PATH . NASSER BELIEVE IN CENTRALIZE , AUTHORITARIANCONTROL . THE BAATH PARTY FAVORS " COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP " AND ADEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT . AS THE TALKS PROCEEDED, SYRIA'SDEPUTY PREMIER NIHAD ELKASSEM REPORTEDLY FORCED THE BAATHISTS IN HISDELEGATION TO ACCEPT THE NASSERITE PROPOSALS ON A THREAT OF RESIGNINGFROM OFFICE . TOTAL ADHERENCE . THE CONFEREES WERE REPORTED " IN CLOSEAGREEMENT' ON A PLANNED UNION THAT INDICATED COMPROMISES WERE BEINGMADE BY BOTH SIDES . IF ACCEPTED BY INDIVIDUAL PLEBISCITES, THE UNIONWOULD CREATE A SINGLE ARAB STATE OF 39 MILLION PEOPLE WITH AN AREA ASFLAT AS TEXAS AND MORE THAN TWICE ITS SIZE, AND AN ECONOMY BASED ON THEOIL OF IRAQ, THE AGRICULTURE OF SYRIA, AN THE INDUSTRY AND COTTON OFEGYPT . THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A SINGLE POLITICAL HEAD (ALMOST CERTAINTO BE NASSER) AND A CENTRAL PARLIAMENT BASED ON POPULATION, WHICH WOULDGIVE EGYPT A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY . THIS CENTRAL STATE WOULD BERESPONSIBLE FOR 1) DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY, 2) A SOCIALIST ECONOMICFRAMEWORK, AND 3) UNIFIED EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL PROGRAMS . BUTWITHIN THE UNION, EACH STATE WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ELECTED POPULARAUTHORITY AND ITS OWN PARLIAMENT . NOT REPRESENTED IN THE CAIRO TALKSWAS PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHOSE BOSS, ABDULLAH SALLAL, IS PROPPED UP BY20,000 EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS, BUT SALLAL CABLED CAIRO ANNOUNCING HIS TOTALADHERENCE TO WHATEVER IS DECIDED . BUT AT WEEK'S END, THE REPORTED "CLOSE AGREEMENT " HAD APPARENTLY RUN INTO A SNAG . THE THREEPOWER TALKSUNEXPECTEDLY BROKE UP AND, ACCORDING TO A COMMUNIQUE, WILL RESUME " INA FEW DAYS . " WHILE TRYING, AT LEAST, TO UNITE VERBALLY IN CAIRO,IRAQ AND SYRIA WERE STILL BUSY LAST WEEK CONSOLIDATING THEIRREVOLUTIONS AT HOME . IRAQ, WHICH HAS ALREADY EXECUTED 25 LOCALCOMMUNIST LEADERS, CONDEMNED TO DEATH ANOTHER 51 . IN FEEBLERETALIATION, THE SOVIET UNION CREATED A SMALL RIOT IN MOSCOW, WHERE ACROWD OF SEVERAL HUNDRED STUDENTS (INCLUDING SOME FROM ARAB COUNTRIES)WAS PERMITTED TO BREAK WINDOWS AND THROW INK BOTTLES AT THE IRAQIEMBASSY . THE NEW BAGHDAD REGIME ALSO FINALLY SETTLED THE 18-MONTHKURDISH REBELLION BY REACHING BASIC AGREEMENT WITH KURDISH LEADERMUSTAFA BARZANI ON TERMS OF 1) AMNESTY FOR ALL REBELS, 2) RELEASE OF2,000 IRAQI SOLDIERS CAPTURED IN BATTLE, AND 3) AUTONOMY FOR THENATION'S 1,500,000 KURDS . IN SYRIA, TANKS AND ARMORED CARS WERE ATLAST WITHDRAWN FROM DAMASCUS STREETS ALTHOUGH PATROLS OF STEEL-HELMETEDTROOPS STILL REMAINED . REPORTEDLY, ABOUT 1,000 PRISONERS JAMMED THEJAILS, INCLUDING 80 LOCAL COMMUNISTS . SINGLE FLOOR . ARAB NATIONS HAVEOFTEN COMBINED BEFORE ON PAPER WITHOUT PREVENTING THE INDIVIDUAL STATESFROM GOING THEIR OWN ANARCHIC WAY . A SINGLE MILITARY COMMAND WASAGREED UPON AS LONG AGO AS 1951 BUT NEVER IMPLEMENTED . THE NEW UNIONMAY EVENTUALLY PROVE TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN ANOTHER EXERCISE INRHETORIC, BUT LAST WEEK THE NEWS OF ITS FORMATION SENT A THRILL OFEXCITEMENT THROUGH PRONASSER ELEMENTS IN JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, THETWO REMAINING ARAB STATES WHOSE LEADERS ARE VOCALLY ANTI-NASSER . SOMEPEOPLE IN THE ARAB WORLD PREDICT THAT REVOLT WILL STRIKE JORDAN WITHINA FEW WEEKS, AND SAUDI ARABIA IN A MATTER OF MONTHS . JORDAN'S YOUNGKING HUSSEIN, DETERMINED TO NIP ANY PLOT IN THE BUD, SPENT LAST WEEKINSPECTING HIS JORDANIAN TROOPS AND WAS GREETED WITH CHEERS . JORDAN'SIMPRISONED BAATHIST LEADER, RIFAT AUDEH, BROKE JAIL BUT WAS QUICKLYRECAPTURED . IN SAUDI ARABIA, PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL COMPLETED ANUNPRECEDENTED SPEECHMAKING SWING AROUND THE NATION AND ANNOUNCED THAT9,000 MEN HAD VOLUNTEERED FOR HIS NEW NATIONAL GUARD . KING SAUD,HOWEVER, PLAYED INTO THE HANDS OF THE MONARCHY'S CRITICS WHEN HEPROPOSED CONTINIING HIS EXTRAVAGANT FOUR-MONTH CONVALESCENCE (FROMHEART AND POLITICAL FAILURES) BY MOVING FROM SWITZERLAND TO THE FRENCHRIVIERA . FOR THIS WEEK, SAUD HAS MADE RESERVATIONS AT NICE'S HOTELNEGRESCO FOR HIMSELF AND 130 RELATIVES AND RETAINERS, WHO WILL OCCUPYALL 50 ROOMS ON A SINGLE FLOOR, WITH A SPECIAL ELEVATOR RESERVED FORHIS PERSONAL USE .
