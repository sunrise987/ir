NONETHELESS SINCE1956 MOROCCO HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO ANNEX " THE STOLEN SANDS OFMAURITANIA, " WHICH IT CLAIMS WERE ILLEGALLY TAKEN FROM COLONIALMOROCCO BY FRENCH ARMY SURVEYORS THE LATE KING MOHAMMED V, A " MOROCCANLIBERATION ARMY " EVEN TRIED TO " FREE " MAURITANIA ; WITH SUPPORTFROM RUSSIA, MOROCCO MANAGED TO KEEP THE NEW NATION OUT OF THE U.N .FOR A WHOLE YEAR .
