SPAIN TROUBLE THIS SUMMER ? ONE DAY LAST WEEK, THREEIMPATIENT SHRIEKS OF A LOCOMOTIVE WHISTLE SHATTERED THE MORNING CALM OFSANLUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, A SMALL SPANISH CITY IN THE GRAPE COUNTRY AROUNDCADIZ . ON THE DUSTY RAILROAD PLATFORM, THE STATIONMASTER NERVOUSLYPACED BACK AND FORTH WAITING FOR THE EXPECTED PASSENGERS, SEASONALWORKERS WHO COMMUTE TO THEIR JOBS IN THE VINEYARDS . BUT SCARCELY ASOUL SHOWED UP AT THE STATION, FOR IN SANLUCAR AND NEARBY JEREZ DE LAFRONTERA 3,900 WORKERS WERE OUT ON STRIKE FOR A $2.50 DAILY WAGE (A 50#$ BOOST), PORTAL-TO-PORTAL PAY BETWEEN THE VINEYARD AND HOME, AND TWONOT ONE DAILY CIGARS, THE SLANG WORD FOR THE WORKERS' TRADITIONAL20-MINUTE SIESTA . THE STRIKE WAS THE LATEST AND BIGGEST IN A WAVE OFLABOR UNREST THAT HAS SWEPT DICTATOR FRANCISCO FRANCO'S SPAIN THISSPRING . IN BARCELONA THE HISPANO SUIZA AIRPLANE-ENGINE PLANT RECENTLYLAID OFF 150 EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING A SERIES OF WORK SLOWDOWNS, WAS FORCEDTO HIRE THEM BACK WHEN 2,000 OLIVETTI FACTORY EMPLOYEES THREATENED ASYMPATHY WALKOUT . TWO SITDOWN STRIKES IN A SINGLE WEEK DISRUPTED WORKIN A SEVILLE TEXTILE PLANT . SIX HUNDRED MADRID METALWORKERS HAVE BEENTHREATENING SIMILAR TROUBLE AFTER STUBBORNLY REFUSING TO SIGN A NEWCONTRACT . AID FROM THE PRIESTS . THE COMPLAINTS ARE MANY, FOR THESPANISH WORKER PUTS IN LONGER HOURS FOR LESS PAY THAN ALMOST ANY OTHERWORKER IN WESTERN EUROPE, AND STRIKES ARE LEGALLY BANNED . WHEN ELCAUDILLO GRANTED SUBSTANTIAL WAGE BOOSTS FOR THE 60,000 STRIKINGASTURIAS COAL MINERS LAST SUMMER, HE MERELY WHETTED THE APPETITES OFWORKERS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ; ANOTHER INCREASE LAST JAN . 1,RAISING UNSKILLED LABORERS FROM A MINIMUM 60 #$ TO $1 PER DAY, DID NOTHELP THE MILLIONS OF SKILLED WORKERS ABOVE THIS MEAGER FLOOR . OPENLYBACKING THE LATEST WAVE OF STRIKES ARE THE PRIESTS OF THE WORKERS'BROTHERHOODS OF CATHOLIC ACTION AND SEVERAL SMALL BUT EFFECTIVECATHOLIC LAY ORGANIZATIONS THAT REGULARLY BLAST THE CAUDILLO'S TIGHTCONTROLS ON WORKERS FROM BENEATH THE SHELTERING WING OF THE CHURCH .ONE SUCH GROUP, THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN WORKERS, PUBLISHES AN UNCENSOREDAND OUTSPOKEN MONTHLY BULLETIN, JUVENTUD OBRERA, THAT DEMANDS FREE,WESTERN-STYLE LABOR UNIONS, LASHES OUT AT THE ANACHRONISTIC SINDICATOS,WHICH FIX PRICES AND WAGES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . SAID JOURNAL EDITORFRANCISCO GUERRERO, 25, DESCRIBING HIS MISSION LAST WEEK : " OUR WORKIS GOD'S ANSWER TO THE EVIL NEGATION OF ALL HUMAN VALUES . IT IS THEONLY SALVATION FOR SPAIN'S MASSES, OPPRESSED FROM ABOVE (BY FRANCO) ANDMENACED FROM BELOW (BY THE COMMUNISTS) . " A TRIP TO CADIZ . SUCH FRANKTALK HAS THE REGIME SERIOUSLY WORRIED, AND A FEW OF THE MOREPROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF FRANCO'S AUTHORITARIAN REGIME ARE ANXIOUSLYTRYING TO IMPROVE LABOR CONDITIONS . THE LABOR MINISTRY IS PREPARING ABILL TO LEGALIZE " LABOR " STRIKES (AS DISTINCT FROM " POLITICAL "STRIKES) . ANOTHER MEASURE OF THE REGIME'S CONCERN WAS THE SWIFTSETTLEMENT OF LAST WEEK'S TROUBLE AMONG THE VINEYARD WORKERS OFSANLUCAR AND JEREZ . AS SOON AS WORD OF THE WORK STOPPAGE WAS FLASHEDTO MADRID, A LABOR MINISTRY OFFICIAL RACED TO CADIZ AND PRESSUREDVINEYARD EMPLOYERS INTO BOWING TO MOST OF THE WORKER DEMANDS, INCLUDINGMORE CENTIMOS AS WELL AS THE SECOND CIGAR . TROUBLE WAS OVER FOR THEMOMENT . BUT WORRIED FRANCO AIDES KNOW THAT DOZENS OF IMPORTANT WAGECONTRACTS IN MANY INDUSTRIES ARE UP FOR RENEWAL DURING THE COMING WEEKS. UNLESS PAY BOOSTS ARE GRANTED PROMPTLY, SPAIN IS ALMOST CERTAINLY INFOR A SERIOUS NATION-WIDE WAVE OF STRIKES THIS SUMMER .
