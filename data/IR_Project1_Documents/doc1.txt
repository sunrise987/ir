THE ALLIES AFTER NASSAU IN DECEMBER 1960, THE U.S . FIRSTPROPOSED TO HELP NATO DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE . BUT EUROPEMADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEVISE A PLAN . LAST WEEK, AS THEY STUDIED THENASSAU ACCORD BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN,EUROPEANS SAW EMERGING THE FIRST OUTLINES OF THE NUCLEAR NATO THAT THEU.S . WANTS AND WILL SUPPORT . IT ALL SPRANG FROM THE ANGLO-U.S .CRISIS OVER CANCELLATION OF THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT MISSILE, AND THEU.S . OFFER TO SUPPLY BRITAIN AND FRANCE WITH THE PROVED POLARIS (TIME,DEC . 28) . THE ONE ALLIED LEADER WHO UNRESERVEDLY WELCOMED THE POLARISOFFER WAS HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO BY THUS KEEPING A SEPARATE NUCLEARDETERRENT FOR BRITAIN HAD SAVED HIS OWN NECK . BACK FROM NASSAU, THEPRIME MINISTER BEAMED THAT BRITAIN NOW HAD A WEAPON THAT " WILL LAST AGENERATION . THE TERMS ARE VERY GOOD . " MANY OTHER BRITONS WERE NOT SOSURE . THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHOULDER NONE OF THE $800 MILLIONDEVELOPMENT COST OF POLARIS, IT HAS ALREADY POURED $28 MILLION INTOSKYBOLT AND WILL HAVE TO SPEND PERHAPS $1 BILLION MORE FOR A FLEET OFMISSILE-PACKING SUBMARINES . AT BEST, THE BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TODESIGN, BUILD AND PROVE ITS NUCLEAR FLEET BEFORE 1970, THREE YEARSAFTER BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE HAS PRESUMABLY BECOME OBSOLETE . THEN WHAT? TORY BACKBENCHERS ARE LOUDLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THEY CALL " THESMALL TYPE " IN THE NASSAU PACT, WHICH STIPULATES THAT BRITAIN'SPOLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, EXCEPT WHEN " SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS "INTERVENE, MUST BE COMMITTED TO A TRULY MULTILATERAL NATO FORCE . DOESTHAT MEAN THAT BRITAIN WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE NO STRIKE FORCE OF ITS OWN? WHO WILL DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFYWITHDRAWAL OF SUBMARINES FROM NATO, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE NATIONALINTERESTS CONFLICT WITH U.S . POLICY ? THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL ISWHETHER FRANCE'S INCLUSION IN THE OFFER WAS A DELIBERATE PLOY BY JACKKENNEDY TO END OR AT LEAST DOWNGRADE BRITAIN'S PRIZED " SPECIALRELATIONSHIP " WITH THE U.S . THE CARTOONISTS WENT EVEN FARTHER . THEYNOT ONLY SHOWED SUPERMAC JUMPING TO SUPERJACK'S COMMANDS, BUT DE GAULLEAND ADENAUER AS WELL . AS EDITH SAID . THE FRENCH, WHO GOT NO HELP FROMTHE U.S . IN DEVELOPING THEIR FORCE DE FRAPPE, WERE QUICK TO CROW THATBRITAIN'S VAUNTED TIES WITH THE U.S . HAD BROUGHT IT NOTHING BUTHUMILIATION . BY CONTRAST, BRAGGED FRENCH OFFICIALS, THE SKYBOLT FIASCOONLY VINDICATED FRANCE'S DECISION TO DEVELOP ITS OWN BOMBS AND DELIVERYSYSTEMS . THUS, THOUGH CHARLES DE GAULLE PROMISED TO " REFLECT " ON THEPOLARIS OFFER, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ANYOFFER THAT WOULD SUBJECT A FRENCH FORCE TO ALLIED CONTROL . IT IS DEGAULLE'S UNSWERVING CONVICTION THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY TOINVADE WESTERN EUROPE, NO NATION THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTACKED MEANINGTHE U.S . WOULD INVITE NUCLEAR DEVASTATION BY HELPING ITS ALLIES . THUSUNLIKE BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE, WHICH ALL ALONG HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO "THE WESTERN STRATEGIC DETERRENT, " FRANCE'S FORCE DE FRAPPE WILL BERESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR FRANCE'S DEFENSE . AT THE SAME TIME, DE GAULLE HASLONG ARGUED THAT THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE COULD BE RUN MOST EFFICIENTLY BYA TRIUMVIRATE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRANCE AS AN EQUAL OF THE U.S . ANDBRITAIN . THIS IS ONE OF HIS MAJOR, IF UNSPOKEN, CONDITIONS FOR BRITISHMEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET ; AND DE GAULLE SUGGESTED POINTEDLY TOMACMILLAN THAT IT WOULD HELP IF BRITAIN WERE TO SHARE ITS ADVANCEDMISSILE TECHNOLOGY WITH FRANCE . WHEN MACMILLAN REPLIED NONCOMMITTALLYTHAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH KENNEDY, DE GAULLE TOLD HISGUEST WITH HAUTEUR THAT FRANCE IN THAT CASE COULD DO NOTHING TO EASEBRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO EUROPE . GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR . KONRAD ADENAUER,ON THE OTHER HAND, IS FEARFUL THAT DE GAULLE WILL SNAP UP THE POLARISOFFER AND IN THIS WAY ACHIEVE HIS GOAL OF A THREE-NATION NATODIRECTORATE . THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT VOWED IN 1954 NOT TO MANUFACTURENUCLEAR WEAPONS, ADENAUER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE THATWITHOUT THEM, AND WITH NO SAY IN THEIR USE, WEST GERMANY WILL BERELEGATED TO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE . LAST WEEK ANOFFICIAL BULLETIN EVEN REVIVED THE OLD, BITTER CRY THAT U.S . PLEAS FORGREATER RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES ARE AIMED AT RAISING GERMAN "CANNON FODDER " FOR U.S . " ATOMIC KNIGHTS . " A FROSTY LETTER FROM THECHANCELLOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY, WHICH ALREADYSUPPLIES ALMOST 50 PER CENT OF NATO GROUND STRENGTH, DOES NOT INTEND TORAISE ANY MORE DIVISIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL WARFARE . YET U.S . STRATEGICPLANNERS REASON THAT THE ONLY CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO SOVIET ATTACK IS ASTRONG ARMY ON THE GROUND, BACKED BY THE VAST U.S . NUCLEAR ARSENAL .FACT IS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD NEVER BE USEDINDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S . AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT INVITING DEVASTATINGSOVIET RETALIATION . AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCHWILL HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A NUCLEAR CAPACITY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 4PER CENT OF U.S . NUCLEAR POWER . " IT IS JUST A DAMNED NUISANCE, "SAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAST WEEK . " IT MEANS NOTHINGMILITARILY EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BAIL OUT THE FIRSTCOUNTRY THAT THROWS THE FIRST PEA AT THE RUSSIANS OR ANYONE ELSE . "CHARLES DE GAULLE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO AGREE, AT LEAST UNTIL HISFORCE DE FRAPPE BECOMES OBSOLETE . FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY, THEMULTILATERAL DETERRENT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE . EVENTUALLY, FRANCE, TOO,MAY WELL FIND A NATO-CONTROLLED POLARIS FLEET, OR ITS POSSIBLESUCCESSOR, A EUROPEAN MINUTEMAN ARSENAL, THE ONLY ANSWER TO THESPIRALING COST AND DIMINISHING VALUE OF GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR .
