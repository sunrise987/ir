RIOT POLICE AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS PATROLLED THEDARK AND DESERTED CITY . ROADBLOCKS WERE SET UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS, ANDBARBED-WIRE BARRICADES ENCIRCLED THE SACRED TUDAM PAGODA . THESEGOVERNMENT SECURITY MEASURES WERE NOT A PRECAUTION AGAINST AN ATTACK BYCOMMUNIST GUERRILLAS ; THEY WERE TAKEN TO QUELL DEMONSTRATIONS BYHUE'S BUDDHIST POPULATION AGAINST THE REGIME OF ROMAN CATHOLICPRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM . WHILE ALL THE WORLD'S ATTENTION WAS FOCUSEDON SOUTH VIET NAM'S BITTER STRUGGLE AGAINST THE REDS, THE COUNTRY WASDIVIDED BY A RELIGIOUS CONFLICT THAT MIGHT IMPERIL THE ENTIRE COURSE OFTHE WAR AGAINST THE VIET CONG . MORALITY CRUSADE . SOUTH VIET NAM'SBUDDHISTS, WHO COMPRISE 80 PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S 15 MILLIONPEOPLE, ARE BITTER OVER ALLEGED FAVORITISM BY DIEM AND HIS CATHOLICRULING FAMILY TOWARD THE NATION'S 1,500,000 CATHOLICS . THE BUDDHISTSHAVE LONG COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT GIVES CATHOLICS THE BEST CIVILSERVICE JOBS AND THAT DIEM, BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT CATHOLICS ARE MORESOLIDLY ANTICOMMUNIST, PROMOTES THEM TO HIGHER POSITIONS IN THE ARMY .MANY YOUNG VIETNAMESE ARMY OFFICERS, CLAIM BUDDHIST LEADERS, HAVEBECOME CONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM TO WIN OFFICIAL FAVOR . " BUT IF THEVIET CONG EVER COME THROUGH THE BARBED WIRE, " SAID ONE U.S . OFFICEROF HIS RECENTLY CONVERTED VIETNAMESE COUNTERPART, " I HAVE A FEELINGHE'LL DO HIS PRAYING TO BUDDHA . " BUDDHISTS FEEL THAT DIEM'SGOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO MAKE CATHOLICISM THE OFFICIAL STATE RELIGION,POINT TO THE MORALITY CRUSADE OF DIEM'S MILITANTLY CATHOLICSISTER-IN-LAW, MME . NGO DINH NHU . IN SHARP VARIANCE WITH THE EASYSOCIAL MORES OF MOST SOUTH VIETNAMESE, MME . NHU HAS BANNED ABORTION,ADULTERY, POLYGAMY, CONCUBINAGE, DIVORCE (EXCEPT BY PRESIDENTIALDISPENSATION), AND THE SALE OF CONTRACEPTIVES . DIEM INDIGANNTLYREPLIED THAT BUDDHIST LEADERS ARE " DAMNED FOOLS " TO THINK THAT HE ISTRYING TO SUPPRESS THEIR RELIGION . " I DON'T FORGET, " HE SAYS, " THAT80 PER CENT OF THE VOTES THAT ELECTED ME PRESIDENT WERE BUDDHIST VOTES. " CATHOLICS MAINTAIN THAT THEY OCCUPY SO MANY INFLUENTIAL POSTS ONLYBECAUSE THEIR CHURCH SCHOOLS TURN OUT FAR BETTER EDUCATED GRADUATESTHAN BUDDHIST SCHOOLS . IN A SHARPLY WORDED STATEMENT, MME . NHUCHALLENGED THE GOOD FAITH OF STRIKING BONZES (MONKS) . " THE ROBE DOESNOT MAKE THE BONZE, " SAID MME . NHU . " IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINEVERY CLOSELY THE COMPORTMENT OF CERTAIN SO-CALLED BUDDHIST MONKS WHOCONTINUE TO MAKE NOT ONLY INCONSIDERATE BUT FALSE REMARKS AND OVERTLYASSUME AN ATTITUDE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR PRESUMED STATE OF HOLY MEN ./ PROTEST STRIKE . THE SITUATION CAME TO A HEAD LAST MONTH IN HUE (POP. 106,000), WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE SEE OF DIEM'S BROTHER, ARCHBISHOPNGO DINH THUC . THOUGH CATHOLICS WERE ALLOWED TO FLY VATICAN FLAGS AT ACHURCH CELEBRATION HONORING ARCHBISHOP THUC, THREE DAYS LATER THEGOVERNMENT FORBADE THE BUDDHISTS TO UNFURL THEIR RELIGIOUS FLAGS FORTHE 2,507TH BIRTHDAY OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA . WHEN THE BUDDHISTS STAGED APROTEST MARCH AGAINST THE EDICT, GOVERNMENT ARMORED CARS FIRED OVER THEHEADS OF THE RIOTERS . IN THE MELEE, NINE PEOPLE WERE KILLED . THEBUDDHISTS BLAMED THE SLAUGHTER ON DIEM'S TROOPS ; THE GOVERNMENTBLAMED THE KILLINGS ON COMMUNIST AGITATORS . THE HUE DISASTER CAUSEDBUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . BUDDHIST DELEGATIONSIN SAIGON DEMANDED THE REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR FAITH, EQUALJOB OPPORTUNITIES AND INDEMNITY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE DEAD ANDWOUNDED IN HUE . INSTEAD, THE GOVERNMENT ARRESTED DEMONSTRATORS, BLAMEDTHE UNREST ON " LIARS, FOREIGNERS AND THE VIET CONG . " WHEN ANOTHERBUDDHIST CROWD GATHERED IN HUE LAST WEEK, TROOPS DISPERSED IT WITHCRUDE TEAR-GAS BOMBS THAT SENT 67 PEOPLE TO THE HOSPITAL WITH CHEMICALBURNS . U.S . OFFICIALS IN SAIGON FEAR THAT THE MOUNTING RELIGIOUSSTRIFE CAN ONLY BENEFIT THE VIET CONG BY DIVIDING THE PEOPLE AND THEPREDOMINANTLY BUDDHIST ARMY JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE BEGINNINGTO GAIN A MILITARY ADVANTAGE OVER THE REDS . DIEM MADE SOMECONCILIATORY GESTURES ; BUT WITH THE SITUATION FAST DETERIORATING,THEY MIGHT PROVE NOT TO BE ENOUGH HE ORDERED THE REMOVAL OF THEBARRICADES INHUE AND IN A NATIONWIDE RADIO BROADCAST ADMITTED THAT SOME OF HIS AIDESHAD NOT SHOWN " SUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING AND SENSITIVITY " IN DEALINGWITH THE CRISIS .
