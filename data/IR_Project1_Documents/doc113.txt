OF FIRS, FLIES & FEARS THAW WAS IN THE MOSCOW AIR LAST WEEK,MELTING THE FIRST THIN LAYERS OF SNOW AFTER THE LONG MONTHS OF WINTER .BUT TO THE 500 WRITERS, MUSICIANS, PAINTERS AND POETS GATHERED IN THEKREMLIN'S SVERDLOV HALL LAST WEEK, THE CHANGING SEASON OUTSIDE ONLYUNDERSCORED NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S WORDS OF WARNING SHOUTED FROM THEPLATFORM . KHRUSHCHEV'S DECREE TO RUSSIA'S INTELLECTUALS : NEW IDEASIN RUSSIA MUST REMAIN IN THE DEEP FREEZE INDEFINITELY . " ONE HEARS, "CRIED NIKITA IN HIS 2FHOUR BLAST, " THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR LAISSEZFAIRE, THAT THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN LOOSENED . . . THATEVERYBODY CAN DO AS HE PLEASES . " NO ! THUNDERED KHRUSHCHEV . " THEPARTY IMPLACABLY COMES FORWARD AGAINST ANY IDEOLOGICAL VACILLATION .THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY ABSOLUTE POLITICAL FREEDOM, NOT EVEN UNDERCOMPLETE COMMUNISM . " TAKE YOUR CHOICE . TO RUSSIA'S RULER, IT HADBECOME ALL TOO CLEAR THAT THE RECENT FLOOD OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONPOETRY READINGS BEFORE MASS AUDIENCES, EXHIBITS OF MODERN PAINTINGS,JAZZ IMPORTED FROM ABROAD, BOOKS AND ARTICLES ABOUT THE STALIN TERRORWERE BECOMING DANGEROUS CARRIERS OF ALIEN WESTERN IDEAS, SHAKING THEFOUNDATIONS OF COMMUNITY SOCIETY . DESTALINIZATION, TOUCHED OFF BYNIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF AT THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS IN 1956, HAD GONETOO FAR . NIKITA SPARED NO GROUP IN THE RESTLESS AUDIENCE . WRITER ILYAEHRENBURG, 72, DREW SCORN FOR THE TITLE OF HIS 1954 NOVE, THE THAW,WHICH, SAID NIKITA, SUGGESTS POLITICAL " IMPERMANENCE AND INSTABILITY ./ AS FOR EHRENBURG'S MEMOIRS, WHICH HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN THE LITERARYJOURNAL NOVY MIR, KHRUSHCHEV REMARKED CAUSTICALLY, " ONE NOTICES THATHE DEPICTS EVERYTHING IN GRIM TONES . " KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THE VETERANEHRENBURG AGAINST " SLIPPING INTO AN ANTI-COMMUNIST POSITION . " THENKHRUSHCHEV TURNED ON YOUNG POET EVGENCY EVTUSHENKO : " HE SHOWSVACILLATIONS, INSTABILITY OF VIEWS . . . I WOULD LIKE TO ADVISE COMRADEEVTUSHENKO AND OTHER MEN OF LETTERS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT SEEK CHEAPSENSATIONALISM . " EVERYONE WAS AWARE, NIKITA ANNOUNCED, THATEVTUSHENKO RECENTLY TOLD A PARIS AUDIENCE THAT HIS POEM, BABI YAR(WHICH DREW FIRE FROM THE KREMLIN), HAD BEEN " CRITICIZED BY DOGMATISTS. " SUCH BEHIND-THE-BACK REMARKS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WILL NOT DO,HINTED THE PREMIER : " IF THE ENEMIES OF OUR CAUSE BEGIN TO PRAISE YOUFOR WORKS CONVENIENT TO THEIR PURPOSE, THEN THE PEOPLE WILL JUSTLYCRITICIZE YOU . SO CHOOSE WHAT SUITS YOU BEST . " LOVE FOR TREES .KHRUSHCHEV DESCRIBED WITH HORROR A RECENT JAZZ CONCERT HE ATTENDED ( "ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HIDE, BUT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO HIDE " ),EXPRESSED DEEP DISTASTE AT SUCH NEW DANCE CRAZES AS THE TWIST ( "SIMPLY OBSCENITIES, SOME SORT OF FRENZY, THE DEVIL KNOWS WHAT " ), ANDTURNED ON THE PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS WITH UNDISGUISED FURY . SOME, HEROARED, SEEK INSPIRATION IN " RUBBISH HEAPS AND STINKING LATRINES, " OR/ PRESENT PEOPLE IN AN INTENTIONALLY UGLY ASPECT . " SUCH A MAN WASERNEST NEIZVESTNY, A SCULPTOR WHO HAS RECENTLY WON WIDE ACCLAIM INMOSCOW'S ART WORLD WITH HIS PROVOCATIVE WORKS . BUT TO KHRUSHCHEV, HISWORK WAS JUST A " NAUSEATING CONCOCTION . IT IS A GOOD THING WE DO NOTHAVE MANY SUCH ARTISTS, " HE SAID . JUST WHAT WERE NIKITA'S TASTES ?FOR A MOMENT, HIS IMAGINATION TOOK FLIGHT, AS THE AUDIENCE LISTENEDNERVOUSLY : " RECENTLY I WAS WATCHING THE SUN RISE ON A FOREST COVEREDIN HOARFROST . I SAID TO THOSE WITH ME : " LOOK AT THOSE FIR TREES, ATTHEIR ATTIRE, AT THOSE SNOWFLAKES GLISTENING IN THE RAYS OF THE SUN .HOW WONDERFULLY BEAUTIFUL THAT IS ! ' YET THE MODERNISTS ANDABSTRACTIONISTS WANT TO PAINT THESE FIR TREES WITH THEIR ROOTS IN THEAIR, AND THEY SAID THIS IS NEW, PROGRESSIVE ART . " TIME TO SHUT UP .RUNNING THROUGH HIS SPEECH WAS THE CLEAR SUGGESTION THAT KHRUSHCHEVFELT HIS OWN ROOTS WERE IN DANGER . TOO MANY OF THE INTELLECTUALS WEREDEVOTING THEIR WORK TO EXPOSURE OF THE EXCESSES OF TERROR IN THE STALINERA WHICH WAS STRIKING PRETTY CLOSE TO HOME, SINCE KHRUSHCHEV HAD BEENSTALIN'S HENCHMAN THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD . " THE QUESTION IS SOMETIMESASKED, " NIKITA ADMITTED, " DID THE LEADING PEOPLE OF THE PARTY KNOWABOUT THE ARRESTS AT THE TIME ? YES, THEY KNEW . BUT DID THEY KNOWTHAT COMPLETELY INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE BEING ARRESTED .? NO, THEY DIDNOT KNOW . " ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH NIKITA'S 1956 DESTALINIZATION SPEECHTO THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS KNEW THIS TO BE A LIE, FOR HE HAD OPENLYDISCUSSED STALIN'S MURDEROUS POLITICAL PURGES OF THE 1930S . NOW, HESAID, WAS THE TIME TO SHUT UP ABOUT THE DARK CHAPTERS OF HISTORY . "ALL ATTENTION IS BEING ONE-SIDEDLY CONCENTRATED ON LAWLESSNESS AND THEABUSEOF POWER . HERE ONE NEEDS MODERATION . IF ALL WRITERS BEGAN TO WRITEONLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHAT SORT OF LITERATURE WOULD THERE BE .? WHOWOULD DASH FOR IT ? FLIES, ENORMOUS FAT FLIES . EVERY SORT OFBOURGEOIS SCUM FROM ABROAD WILL CRAWL TOWARD IT . " WHEN KHRUSHCHEV'SSPEECH WAS OVER, THE STUNNED AUDIENCE LEFT THE HALL WEARING THE OLD,FAMILIAR STONY STARES OF STALIN'S DAY . IT WOULD BE HARD TO FORCE THEMALL INTO PUBLIC RECANTATIONS ; IN FACT, A SURPRISING NUMBER STAYEDSILENT . BUT SURE ENOUGH, SOME CAVED IN QUICKLY TO THE CULTURAL PURGE .WITHIN 48 HOURS, THE MOSCOW WRITERS UNION HAD OUSTED ITS LIBERALCHAIRMAN, POET STEPAN SHCHIPACHOV, AND REPLACED HIM WITH A REGIMETRUSTY . AND AS FOR HAPLESS ERNEST NEIZVESTNY, THE SCULPTOR DENOUNCEDPERSONALLY BY NIKITA, HE SOON SHOWED UP IN PRAVDA WITH AN OBEDIENTSTATEMENT, HAILING THE " MARXIST-LENINIST WORLD OUTLOOK " AND PROMISINGTO " WORK MORE, BETTER, MORE IDEOLOGICALLY, MORE EXPRESSIVELY .
