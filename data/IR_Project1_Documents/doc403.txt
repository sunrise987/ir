UP FOR DEBATE IS NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S SWEEPING PLAN FOREXPANSION OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TO RAISE FERTILIZER PRODUCTION FROM20 MILLION TONS THIS YEAR TO 108 MILLION TONS BY 1970 . FERTILIZER HASBECOME A KIND OF RITUAL INCANTATION ; NIKITA IS OBVIOUSLY CONVINCEDTHAT ONLY ITS VASTLY INCREASED USE CAN RAISE PRODUCTION ENOUGH TO AVOIDDRASTIC FOOD CUTS OR PERMANENT DEPENDENCE ON EXPENSIVE FOREIGN FARMPRODUCTS, SUCH AS THE 11 MILLION TONS OF WHEAT THE SOVIETS ARE BUYINGFROM THE WEST .
