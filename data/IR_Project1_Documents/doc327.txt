BURMA HAS 1,370 MILES OF MOUNTAINOUS BORDER WITH REDCHINA, AND, SAYS AN EASTERN EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT, " PRACTICING SOCIALISMIN SUCH PROXIMITY TO COMMUNISM IS LIKE WALKING A TIGHTROPE IN A TYPHOON. " IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NE WIN HAS NOT YET BEEN BLOWN OFF THETIGHTROPE, HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN WHAT PASSES FOR NEUTRALITY : MILDYHOSTILE TOWARD THE U.S., FRIENDLY TOWARD CHINA (WITHOUT, HOWEVER,ENDORSING PEKING'S ATTACK AGAINST INDIA), FRIENDLIER TOWARD MOSCOW AND,OF COURSE, ACCEPTING AID FROM ALL THREE .

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HASFALLEN 40 PER CENT IN THREE MONTHS AND URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS SOARED .THE FEW REMAINING PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE CLAMORING FOR NATIONALIZATION,HOPING TO GET A BETTER BREAK ON RAW MATERIAL ALLOCATIONS AND SOMEPROTECTION AGAINST STRIKES . BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO FEW TRAINEDADMINISTRATORS TO RUN ANY MORE ENTERPRISES, NE WIN LAST WEEK WAS FORCEDTO REFUSE ALL FUTURE NATIONALIZATION PETITIONS . ALTHOUGH IN THE PASTTHE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED WORKERS TO STRIKE AGAINST PRIVATE EMPLOYERSIN STATE-RUN BUSINESSES, STRIKES ARE CONSIDERED UNPATRIOTIC NE WIN LASTWEEK URGED LABOR TO MODERATE ITS WAGE DEMANDS, IN A BELATED ATTEMPT TOPACIFY BUSINESSMEN .

HIS FAIRLYCOMPETENT ARMY OF 50,000 MEN CONTROLS THE MAIN CITIES AND ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE TEXAS-SIZED NATION . ABOUT 35 PER CENT OF THE AREA IS NOMAN'S LAND, AND THE REMAINING 15 PER CENT IS DIVIDED AMONG A VARIETY OFINSURGENTS, RANGING FROM TRIBAL GROUPS, SUCH AS THE SHANS, KARENS ANDKACHINS, TO TWO MAJOR BANDS OF COMMUNIST INSURGENTS, 1) THE TROTSKYITERED FLAG MOVEMENT, AND 2) THE LARGER WHITE FLAG COMMUNISTS, WHO AREFRAGMENTED INTO STALINIST AND REVISIONIST WINGS . STILL ANOTHERINSURGENT OUTFIT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL HUNDRED CHINESE NATIONALISTSOLDIERS WHO FLED THEIR HOMELAND YEARS AGO AND HAVE SINCE OPERATED ASBANDITS .IN VAIN, PREVIOUS BURMESE GOVERNMENTSHAVE OFFERED AMNESTIES TO THE REBELS . NE WIN WENT FARTHER : HEPROMISED A SAFE-CONDUCT TO REBEL LEADERS FOR DISCUSSIONS IN RANGOON .RED FLAG LEADER THAKIN SOE ACCEPTED . HE WAS PICKED UP BY A RIVERGUNBOAT, TAKEN TO A GOVERNMENT AIRFIELD AND FLOWN TO RANGOON, WHERE HEPROMPTLY DEMANDED 1) A NATIONWIDE CEASE-FIRE, 2) WITHDRAWAL OF BURMESETROOPS FROM VITAL RED FLAG AREAS, AND 3) A MEETING OF ALL POLITICALFACTIONS LEGAL AND ILLEGAL TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT . TAKEN ABACK BYTHESE DEMANDS, NE WIN DENOUNCED THAKIN SOE AS " INSINCERE " AND GAVEHIM SEVEN DAYS' IMMUNITY TO GET BACK TO THE SAFETY OF HIS JUNGLEHIDEOUTS . OPPOSITION . THOUGH NE WIN IS CONCEDED TO BE HONEST ANDHARD-WORKING, EASYGOING BURMESE LONG FOR THE GOOD OLD GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGGOVERNMENT OF U NU, WHOSE PHOTO IS STILL HAWKED ON THE STREETS ANDOUTSELLS THAT OF NE WIN BY A WIDE MARGIN . ONE OPPOSITION LEADER, U BASWE, CALLED ON NE WIN " TO RETREAT FROM THE BRINK OF DISASTER FOR THESAKE OF THE NATION, " AND THE EX-AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., U WIN,DEMANDEDA RETURN TO PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY . BOTH WERE PACKED OFF TO "PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, " ALONG WITH NINE OTHER DISSENTERS FROM INSTANTSOCIALISM . NERVOUS NE WIN FREQUENTLY CARRIES A PISTOL, ANDANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS STAND READY AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE . YET, EVEN THOUGHOPPOSITION TO HIS REGIME IS MASSIVE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, HE STILLHAS THE BULK OF THE ARMY WITH HIM . AND, AS IS HIS HABIT WHEN HEENCOUNTERS OBSTACLES, NE WIN CHANGED COURSE SLIGHTLY . HE TEMPORARILYRESCINDED CONTROLS ON RICE TO PLACATE FARMERS, OFFERED TO BUILD A NEWSTUDENT UNION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RANGOON (HE HAD BLOWN UP THE OLD ONEAFTER A STUDENT RIOT IN JULY 1962), AND CALLED A CONFERENCE OF HISADMINISTRATORS TO " IMPROVE AND REVIEW " ALL MEASURES ENACTED BY THEGOVERNMENT . PRESUMABLY TO SHOW HE IS NOT A TOTAL TYRANT, NE WINRELEASED THREE FORMER CABINET MINISTERS (BUT NOT EX-PREMIER U NU) FROMHOUSE ARREST . UNLESS THE ARMY STAGES A COUP, NE WIN MAY MUDDLE ALONGINDEFINITELY . " IT'S NOT THE BURMESE WAY TO MAN THE BARRICADES, "EXPLAINED A RANGOON EDUCATOR . " GIVEN OUR PLENTIFUL FOOD SUPPLIES ANDTHE PASSIVITY OF THE PEOPLE, IT'S POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO MISRULE BURMAFOR PERHAPS A DECADE BEFORE INCURRING TRUE WRATH . /
