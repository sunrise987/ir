IRAQUNTIL THE NEXT COUP FOR A WHILE LAST WEEK IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO TELLWHO WAS UP AND WHO WAS DOWN IN IRAQ . PERHAPS THE PRINCIPALS THEMSELVESWERE NOT SURE . TWO WEEKS AGO, THE BAATH PARTY (TIME, NOV . 22) SEEMEDFIRMLY IN CONTROL . THE COUNTRY'S NON-BAATHIST PRESIDENT, FIELD MARSHALABDUL SALAM AREF, SEEMED A MERE FIGUREHEAD, KEPT ON FOR HIS PRESTIGEAND POPULARITY . THEN AN INTERNECINE CONFLICT ERUPTED BETWEEN BAATH'SANTI-WESTERN, ANTI-BOURGEOIS AND ANTI-AREF RADICAL WING AND A MORECONCILIATORY MODERATE FACTION . RUSHING IN FROM NEIGHBORING SYRIA, THEBAATH PARTY'S HOME BASE, THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER MICHEL AFLAKAPPEARED TO SETTLE THE MATTER BY EXILING THE LEADERS OF THE OPPOSINGFACTIONS . ALTHOUGH SYRIAN-DOMINATED, THE PARTY LEADERS TOOK CHARGE INIRAQ, PLACED AREF UNDER PALACE ARREST AND TURNED BAGHDAD OVER TO THENATIONAL GUARD, A BAATH-LED OUTFIT FOR WHICH THE REGULAR ARMY HASCONTEMPT . WHEN THE BAATH BOSSES OVERCONFIDENTLY RELEASED AREF A FEWDAYS LATER, HE PROMPTLY JOINED WITH ANGRY FELLOW OFFICERS TO HEAD ACOUP . AT DAWN ONE MORNING LAST WEEK, THE ARMY ATTACKED BAGHDAD WITHSIX INFANTRY BATTALIONS, SUPPORTED BY ARMOR, ARTILLERY AND JETS .THOUGH THE NATIONAL GUARD HAD NO HEAVY WEAPONS, THEY FOUGHTDESPERATELY, LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN . THREE DAYS AFTER THE REVOLT,BAGHDAD WAS IN AREF'S HANDS . SINCE THE BAATH PARTY IS NASSER'SARCHENEMY, THE COUP WAS AT FIRST HAILED IN EGYPT AS PRO-NASSER . IT WASALSO DENOUNCED IN SYRIA AS ANTI-BAATH . BOTH CONCLUSIONS MAY BEPREMATURE . THE COUP LOOKED MORE LIKE A MILITARY THAN A POLITICALAFFAIR, DESIGNED TO PURGE IRAQ OF BAATH ELEMENTS WHO HAD HAD THETEMERITY TO DOWNGRADE THE ARMY IN FAVOR OF THE NATIONAL GUARD . THOUGHHE PACKED THE SYRIAN BAATH LEADERS OFF TO DAMASCUS, AREF INCLUDED INHIS NEW CABINET NINE MODERATE BAATHISTS . STILL, THE MIDDLE EAST BEINGWHAT IT IS, AREF MAY WELL JOIN WITH NASSER, AN OLD FRIEND, TO OVERTHROWTHE BAATH LEADERSHIP IN SYRIA . EVEN MORE LIKELY, THE BAATH LEADERSHIPWILL TRY TO OVERTHROW AREF . JUST ABOUT THE ONLY CERTAINTY IN THESITUATION IS THAT THERE IS BOUND TO BE ANOTHER COUP, IN BAGHDAD OR INDAMASCUS, IF NOT BOTH .
