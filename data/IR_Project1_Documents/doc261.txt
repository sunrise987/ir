GREAT BRITAIN THE TIME OF THE TROLLOP " A GREATPARTY, " CRIED VISCOUNT HAILSHAM ON TV LAST WEEK, " IS NOT TO BEBROUGHT DOWN BY A WOMAN OF EASY VIRTUE ! " BUT THE POSSIBILITY WASREAL ENOUGH . IN THE HUSE OF COMMONS THIS WEEK, PRIME MINISTER HAROLDMACMILLAN WOULD HAVE TO CONFRONT CRITICISM FROM THE LABORITES, PLUSSOME BARELY SUPPRESSED DISSENT IN HIS OWN PARTY, OF THE WAY IN WHICH HEHANDLED, OR MISHANDLED, THE PROFUMO SCANDAL . IN THE LONG RUN, THETORIES FACED AN EVEN MORE ELUSIVE AND INSIDIOUS THREAT THANPARLIAMENTARY ATTACKS THE FACTS IN POLICE DOSSIERS AND IN THE PRIVATELIVES OF PEOPLE WHO PERSONIFY CONSERVATIVE RULE . A LIE IN THE NUDE .THE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE DEBATE IN THE COMMONS CONSISTED MOSTLY OFTALK BUT WHAT TALK . CHRISTINE KEELER, THE CAUSE OF IT ALL, WASSTRANGELY IRREPRESSIBLE AND OUTWARDLY SERENE AMID THE TUMBLING OFFACADES AND THE CRASH OF REPUTATIONS . BLOSSOMING FORTH IN EVER MOREDAZZLING PHOTOGRAPHS SHE BECAME BRITAIN'S FASTEST-RISING FALLEN WOMAN .SHE WAS BESIEGED BY FILM AND NIGHTCLUB OFFERS AND INCORPORATED HERSELFAS CHRISTINE KEELER, LTD . SHE EVEN LANDED, UNCAPTIONED, ON THE COVEROF THE AUSTERE ECONOMIST . AS FOR HER MENTOR, OSTEOPATH STEPHEN WARD,HE WAS IN JAIL, BOUND FOR TRIAL ON CHARGES OF LIVING ON PROSTITUTES'EARNINGS . THE EVIDENCE, IT WAS WIDELY SUSPECTED, WOULD PROVE DAMAGINGTO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE . ALTHOUGH THE LABOR PARTY CONCENTRATED ON THESECURITY QUESTION, IN PUBLIC DEBATE THE PROFUMO CASE INEVITABLY TURNEDINTO A MORAL ISSUE . SIGNIFICANTLY, THE UNPARDONABLE CRIME OFEX-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR JOHN PROFUMO WAS NOT THAT HE WASINDISCREET AND A POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK, BUT THAT HE LIED TO THE HOUSEOF COMMONS IN INITIALLY DENYING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISTINE .MOREOVER, HE LIED STUPIDLY, SINCE HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIS DIGNITY ANDHIS SEAT AS AN M.P . BY ADMITTING HIS MISSTEP . AS A LIMERICK THAT MADETHE ROUNDS OF WESTMINSTER LAST WEEK HAD IT : " WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOUDONE .? " SAID CHRISTINE, " YOU HAVE WRECKED THE WHOLE PARTY MACHINE. " TO LIE IN THE NUDE " IS NOT AT ALL RUDE, " BUT TO LIE IN THE HOUSEIS OBSCENE . /SERIALIZED SEX . THE LABOR PARTY RALLIED FORBATTLE WITH ENTHUSIASM . RETURNING FROM A WEEK'S VISIT TO MOSCOW ANDPLEASANT IF FUTILE CHATS WITH KHRUSHCHEV ABOUT DISARMAMENT, LABOR PARTYLEADER HAROLD WILSON HINTED HE WOULD PRODUCE NEW EVIDENCE THIS WEEK TOSHOW THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS BREACHED . HE HAD GOOD REASONFOR CONFIDENCE : THE DAILY MAIL'S NATIONAL OPINION POLL GAVE LABOR ITSBIGGEST LEAD EVER : 69.2 PER CENT TO 19.8 PER CENT OVER THE TORIES .ON HIS RETURN FROM A GOLFING VACATION, MACMILLAN'S FIRST OBJECTIVE WASTO COMMAND A UNITED CABINET . CALLING HIS MINISTERS INTO EMERGENCYSESSION, HE ASKED EACH MAN TO OUTLINE PRIVATELY HIS OWN VIEW OF THESITUATION . WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE 21 TOP TORIES EXPRESSED DEEP DISMAYAT THE PUBLIC'S LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT . MACMILLAN WASCAUGHT BETWEEN TWO ALMOST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITIES . HAD HEKNOWN ABOUT PROFUMO'S DOINGS, AND IN THAT CASE HAD HE NOT CONNIVED TOSOME EXTENT IN HIS FALSE DENIALS ? OR, DESPITE THE WAR MINISTER'SLONG REPUTATION AS A WOMANIZER, HAD MACMILLAN REALLY NOT KNOWN ANYTHING? IN THAT CASE, HAD HE NOT BEEN NAIVE AND NEGLIGENT WHEN HE ACCEPTEDPROFUMO'S DEFENSE ? BED & BAWD . IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, MACMILLANMAINTAINS THAT HE WAS FIRST INFORMED OF PROFUMO'S LIAISON LAST FEBRUARY. HE DENIES REPORTS THAT MI-5 BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD WARNED THEGOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME THAT ITS WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED BED AND BAWDWITH SOVIET ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV . MACMILLAN INSISTEDTHAT HE HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT A MAN OF PROFUMO'S BACKGROUND (HARROW,OXFORD, INFANTRY) . MOREOVER, FIVE OF HIS MINISTERS WHO " SAT UP HALFTHE NIGHT " OF MARCH 21 INTERROGATING PROFUMO WERE ALSO PERSUADED THATHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ; THE CLINCHER WAS THE WAR MINISTER'SREADINESS TO DENY MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE KEELER IN A SACROSANCT "PERSONAL STATEMENT " ON THE HOUSE FLOOR NEXT DAY . MACMILLAN'SSTRONGEST ARGUMENT WAS THAT A SECURITY CHECK, WHICH HE ORDERED A WEEKBEFORE HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE'S CONFESSION, HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCETHAT THE RUSSIAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN USING THE PROFUMO-KEELER-IVANOVTRIANGLE TO PRY OUT SECRET INFORMATION . SOMETHING OF A CABINET MUTINYSEEMED TO BE LED BY HEALTH MINISTER ENOCH POWELL, 51, WHOSE DISTASTEFOR POLITICAL COMPROMISE LED HIM TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958IN PROTEST AGAINST AN INFLATIONARY, VOTE-CATCHING BUDGET . POWELL'SFEELING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ONCE MORE SHOWN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLY LAXWAS SHARED TO A LESSER DEGREE BY TWO MORE OF MACMILLAN'S ABLESTAPPOINTEES, EDUCATION MINISTER SIR EDWARD BOYLE (WHO QUIT THEGOVERNMENT OVER SUEZ) AND HOUSING MINISTER SIR KEITH JOSEPH, AS WELL ASA DISGRUNTLED MINORITY OF TORY BACKBENCHERS, WHO COULD THEMSELVESOVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IF 20 OR 30 CHOSE TO ABSTAIN THIS WEEK . BUTMACMILLAN'S ASSURANCES QUELLED THE MUTINY, AND THE TORIES MARCHED INTOCOMMONS OUTWARDLY UNITED TO FACE THEIR GREATEST POLITICAL THREAT SINCESUEZ .ANATTEMPT TO FIND OUT THE DATE ON WHICH THE U.S . WAS SUPPOSED TO " GIVETHE H-BOMB TO WEST GERMANY, " SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PROPAGANDA PLOY THANSERIOUS ESPIONAGE . FLASH OF INDIGNATION . THE OPPOSITION MAY YETSUCCEED IN SHOWING THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS IN FACT BREACHED,OR THAT WARNINGS FROM INTELLIGENCE FELL ON DEAF EARS . WHATEVER THEOUTCOME OF THIS WEEK'S COMMONS DEBATE, THERE IS A GROWING BELIEF THATMACMILLAN WILL HAVE TO STEP DOWN EVENTUALLY AND MAY IN FACT HAVEPROMISED HIS OWN DISSIDENT MINISTERS TO DO SO ONCE THE HEAT IS OFF .LOOSE FACTIONS WERE ALREADY FORMING AROUND SUCH POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TOMACMILLAN AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . A . ( " RAB " ) BUTLER,CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING AND SCIENCE MINISTER LORDHAILSHAM . NO MATTER HOW ELOQUENTLY MACMILLAN MAY WEATHER THEPARLIAMENTARY CRISIS, THE TORIES SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TARRED BYCHRISTINE . WHAT THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY OFFERED THE NATION IS MEN BORNAND RAISED IN THE EXACTING DISCIPLINES OF LEADERSHIP . IF NOW, INADDITION TO ALL THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REVERSES THEY HAVE SUFFEREDIN THE PAST YEAR, BRITONS SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT ETONIAN AND HARROVIANLEADERS ARE PERSONALLY NO WISER OR MORE UPRIGHT AND IN MANY CASES THEYHAVE PROVED FLAGRANTLY LESS SO THAN THOSE WHOM THEY GOVERN, TWELVEYEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT MAY END IN A MIGHTY FLASH OF MORAL INDIGNATIONMIXED WITH RIDICULE .
