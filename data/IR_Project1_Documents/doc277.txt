ITALY EPITAPH FOR THE APERTURA ITALY LAST WEEK HAD APREMIER, BUT NO LEADER, A CABINET, BUT NO EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT, AND APARLIAMENT THAT MAY WELL BE DISSOLVED WITHOUT PASSING A SINGLESIGNIFICANT LAW . THE NATION FACED THE PROSPECT OF POLITICAL TURMOILUNMATCHED SINCE THE COMMUNIST BID FOR POWER WAS TURNED BACK IN 1948 .SHUT TIGHT WAS THE RISKY APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT),WITH NO NEW APERTURA IN SIGHT IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION . BROAD JUMP. THE LEFT-CENTER OPENING WAS CREATED 17 MONTHS AGO BY LEFTWINGCHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN ALLIANCE WITH PIETRO NENNI'S SOCIALISTS AND WITHTHE TACIT CONSENT OF THE VATICAN . THE IDEA WAS THAT THIS COALITIONENACT OVERDUE " REFORMS " IN AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND FINANCE,BACKED BY THE SOCIALISTS BUT OPPOSED BY ITALY'S RIGHT-WING PARTIES . ATTHE SAME TIME, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, SOMEWHAT NAIVELY MACHIAVELLIAN,HOPED TO SEPARATE NENNI FROM HIS LONGTIME COMMUNIST ALLIES . NENNI, APRACTICAL POLITICAL JUMPER, SEEMED READY TO LEAP AGAIN . HE HAD BEEN APAL OF MUSSOLINI'S WHEN BOTH WERE YOUNG FASCISTS ; HE SOON BROKE WITHIL DUCE (WHO NEARLY HAD HIM SHOT), FOUGHT AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS UNTILTHE EARLY '30S, MADE UP WITH THEM AFTER THE WAR, WHEN HE TOOK MOST OFHIS PARTY INTO THE RED CAMP . (THE REMAINING ANTI-COMMUNIST SOCIALISTSFORMED ITALY'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNDER GIUSEPPE SARAGAT.) AFTERHUNGARY, NENNI AGAIN PARTLY BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS . NOW, AT 72, HEWAS TOYING WITH BOURGEOIS RESPECTABILITY BY COOPERATING WITH THE CENTERPARTIES BUT HIS OWN FOLLOWERS WERE NOT SO EAGER . THEY MIGHT OWN CARSOR GO SKIING AT ST . MORITZ, BUT MOST OF THEM STILL HANKERED FORALLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNISTS A FEELING THAT WAS REINFORCED BY MASSIVERED GAINS IN THE RECENT NATIONAL ELECTIONS . NENNI MADE A DEAL WITHPREMIERDESIGNATE ALDO MORO FOR THE SOCIALISTS' 87 VOTES IN THE CHAMBEROF DEPUTIES . MORO'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WOULD SUPPORT SOCIALISTDEMANDS FOR 15 NEW REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT THAT INSOME KEY INDUSTRIAL REGIONS SOCIALISTS COULD WIND UP IN JOINT CONTROLWITH THE COMMUNISTS . NENNI IN TURN PROMISED SUPPORT FOR ITALIANPARTICIPATION IN NATO, ALTHOUGH MANY IF NOT MOST OF NENNI'S SOCIALISTSREALLY WANT A NEUTRALIST ITALY . QUICK SWITCH . MEETING TO RATIFY THEMORO-NENNI CONTRACT, MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEETROOPED INTO A BASEMENT HALL OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN VILLA NEAR THE BANK OFTHE TIBER . FROM THE START, THERE WAS TROUBLE . " YOU SAY YOU HAVE ANAGREEMENT ON REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, " SHOUTED A HECKLER AT NENNI, " BUTYOU DON'T SAY WHEN . " HASTILY MOVING ON TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NENNI TOLDHIS GRUMBLING FOLLOWERS THAT " THE ATLANTIC PACT IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTSUPON WHICH RESTS A TROUBLED PEACE A TROUBLED PEACE, IF YOU LIKE, " HEADDED QUICKLY, " BUT ONE WHICH HAS AVOIDED THE OUTBREAK OF WAR .AT THAT HERESY, THERE WAS OPEN REVOLTFROM THE PRO-COMMUNIST CARRISTI (LITERALLY " TANK DRIVERS, " A NICKNAMEDERIVED FROM THE RED TANKS THAT CRUSHED THE HUNGARIAN REBELLION) .ALONE, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO DEFEAT NENNI, BUT NOW LONGTIME NO. 2 MAN RICCARDO LOMBARDI, EAGERLY EYING THE NO . 1 SPOT, ALSO OPPOSEDNENNI . THE ARGUMENT RAGED FOR 8F HOURS . BY 5 : 30 A.M., NENNI WASDEFEATED AND THE ALLIANCE WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HAD COLLAPSED .THE OLD MAN SUBMITTED HIS RESIGNATION ON THE SPOT . IT WAS NOTACCEPTED, BUT THAT HARDLY MATTERED . TO PRESIDENT ANTONIO SEGNI, MOROREPORTED THAT, AFTER 24 DAYS OF TRYING, HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO FORM ANEW LEFTCENTER COALITION . COMMUNIST BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI WASJUBILANT OVER THE CHAOS, CALLED FOR A POPULAR FRONT GOVERNMENT . AT THESAME TIME HE URGED REDS TO " HARVEST YOUR NEIGHBORS' GARDENS, " WHICHMEANT WOOING THE DIVIDED, DEMORALIZED SOCIALISTS IN THE WINE SHOPS,FACTORIES AND FIELDS . LIBERAL LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, WHOSE SMALL,FREE-ENTERPRISE PARTY DOUBLED ITS SHARE OF THE VOTE (FROM 3.5 PER CENTTO 7 PER CENT ) IN THE APRIL ELECTIONS, PLEDGED TO OPEN THE EYES OF "ALL THOSE ITALIANS WHO ARE STILL PRISONERS OF THE MARXIST DREAM,INCLUDING THOSE WHOM THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS ARE DRAWING INTO SOCIALISM. " AS A LAST RESORT, SEGNI TURNED OVER THE TASK OF FORMING A NEWGOVERNMENT TO THE AFFABLE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES,GIOVANNI LEONE, A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT AND THE FIRSTNEAPOLITAN PREMIER . LIKE ANY SON OF NAPLES, LEONE ENJOYS SINGING ;WITH EX-PREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI AT THE PIANO, HE HAS CROONEDNEAPOLITAN LOVE SONGS TO SUCH VISITING DIGNITARIES AS AVERELL HARRIMANAND HAROLD MACMILLAN . SHORT MESSAGE . AFTER ONE DAY, LEONE SUCCEEDEDIN FORMING A GOVERNMENT . IT WAS A MINORITY CABINET OF 22 CHRISTIANDEMOCRATS, MOSTLY " TECHNICIANS, " THAT WOULD STAY IN OFFICE AT LEASTLONG ENOUGH TO APPROVE A NEW BUDGET AND TO GREET PRESIDENT KENNEDY .AFTER THAT, THE PARLIAMENT WILL RECESS FOR THE SUMMER WHILE CHRISTIANDEMOCRATS DEBATE WHETHER TO GAMBLE ON RECOUPING THEIR RECENT LOSSES BYHOLDING NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS THIS FALL . SADLY, MORO WROTE AN EPITAPHFOR THE APERTURA : " THE SOCIALIST PARTY DREW BACK BECAUSE IT CANNOTCONCEIVE OF A POLITICAL LINE OF ITS OWN THAT DOES NOT ENJOY, DIRECTLYOR INDIRECTLY, THE APPROVAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY . TODAY ONE CANNOTCOUNT UPON THE SOCIALIST PARTY FOR THE SOLUTION OF ITALY'S POLITICALPROBLEMS . /
