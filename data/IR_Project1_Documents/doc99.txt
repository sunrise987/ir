YEMEN FOR ALLAH & THE IMAM FROM REMOTE YEMEN LASTSEPTEMBER CAME WORD OF A REVOLUTION THAT HAD TOPPLED THE CENTURIES-OLDDYNASTY OF IMAM MOHAMMED EL BADR . LEADER OF THE COUP WAS COLONELABDULLAH SALLAL, 45, NEWLY APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE PALACE GUARD, WHOANNOUNCED IN THE YEMEN CAPITAL OF SAN " A THAT HIS TROOPS HAD KILLEDTHE IMAM AND WERE IN CONTROL OF THE PRIMITIVE, NEBRASKA-SIZED COUNTRY .WEEKS LATER IT WAS LEARNED THAT BADR HAD IN FACT ESCAPED THE SHELLEDRUINS OF HIS PALACE AND TAKEN REFUGE IN YEMEN'S RUGGED HILL COUNTRY,WHOSE WARLIKE TRIBES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN LOYAL TO THE IMAM .CLOUDED CLAIMS . EVER SINCE, HELPED BY MONEY AND SUPPLIES FROM THEUNEASY MONARCHS OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN, THE IMAM AND HIS TRIBALWARRIORS HAVE BEEN INCHING DOGGEDLY BACK TOWARD SAN " A . PRESIDENTSALLAL APPEALED FOR HELP TO EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, AN OLD FRIENDOF THE IMAM BUT AN EVEN MORE IMPLACABLE FOE OF THE OIL-RICH DESERTDYNASTIES WHO WERE HELPING BADR . NASSER RUSHED IN EGYPTIAN TROOPS,WHOSE SOVIET-MADE GUNS, TANKS AND JETS MAKE THEM THE ARAB WORLD'S MOSTFORMIDABLE FIGHTING FORCE . THOUGH THE REPUBLICANS HAD NOT IN FACT WONTHE WHOLE COUNTRY, THE U.S . DECIDED RELUCTANTLY LAST DECEMBER TORECOGNIZE SALLAL'S REGIME, HAVING FIRST WON NASSER'S PROMISE TOWITHDRAW HIS TROOPS . EGYPT'S PRESIDENT HAS NOT ONLY FAILED TO HONORHIS PLEDGE BUT HAS ACTUALLY RAISED THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO 23,000TROOPS ON THE PRETEXT THAT BRITAIN, SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN HAVE ALLSENT IN FORCES TO HELP THE IMAM . BRITAIN, WHICH HAS NOT RECOGNIZEDSALLAL, FEARS THAT EGYPTIAN PENETRATION OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA WILLISOLATE ITS OILFIELDS AND DEAL A CRIPPLING BLOW TO ITS ECONOMY .FEARFUL LEST THE HOT LITTLE WAR ENGULF THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST, THE U.N. LAST WEEK SENT RALPH BUNCHE, A VETERAN MIDDLE EAST TROUBLESHOOTER WHOIS TRUSTED BY BOTH SIDES, TO DISCUSS A SOLUTION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OFSALLAL AND THE IMAM ; FROM YEMEN HE WILL GO TO EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA ANDJORDAN . THE ACTUAL COURSE OF THE FIGHTING HAS BEEN CLOUDED BY THEGRANDIOSE CLAIMS OF BOTH SIDES AND THE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES THAT FACEWESTERN NEWSMEN WHO EVEN TRY TO GET INTO YEMEN, LET ALONE REACH THEBATTLE LINES . ONE WHO SUCCEEDED WAS TIME CORRESPONDENT GEORGE DECARVALHO . FROM BEIRUT LAST WEEK HE CABLED HIS REPORT ON A 23-DAY TREKIN WHICH HE CROSSED THE PEAKS, PLATEAUS AND WADIS FROM ADEN TO THESAUDI ARABIAN BORDER, TRAVELING A TOTAL OF 1,000 MILES BY CAMEL,DONKEY, CAR AND SHOE LEATHER WITHOUT ONCE LEAVING ROYALISTHELDTERRITORY (SEE MAP) . ALONG THE WAY, CORRESPONDENT DE CARVALHO WASREPEATEDLY SHOT AT BY EGYPTIAN FIGHTER PLANES, TANKS, MORTARS, ANDARTILLERY, SAW TWO OF HIS SIX YEMENI GUARDS KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED INBATTLE . RIFLES & FAITH . THE FIGHTING IS MOST INTENSE IN A 70-MILE ARCCURVING AROUND THE EASTERN APPROACHES TO SAN " A . IN MOST AREAS, THEROYALISTS LIMIT THEMSELVES TO HIT-AND-RUN GUERRILLA RAIDS, BUT HERETHEY ARE TAKING AND HOLDING GROUND, ATTACKING STEADILY AND ADVANCING ONA WIDE FRONT . REPORTS DE CARVALHO : " THE INCREDIBLE FACT IS THAT THEEGYPTIANS ARE LOSING IN YEMEN . RAGGED, BAREFOOT YEMENI TRIBESMEN,ARMED ONLY WITH ANCIENT RIFLES AND FAITH IN ALLAH, ARE KICKING HELL OUTOF NASSER'S ELITE TROOPS DESPITE THEIR OVERPOWERING SOVIET EQUIPMENT,OVERWHELMINGLY SUPERIOR FIREPOWER, AND UNCHALLENGED AIRPOWER . "THE WAR IN YEMEN IS BEING FOUGHT BETWEENTHE 10TH CENTURY AND THE 20TH . THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES HAVE NO OFFICERS'CORPS OR NONCOMS ; THEY SIMPLY CHOOSE THEIR SHEIKS AND FOLLOW THEMINTO BATTLE . " WE CAPTURED 14 FIELD RADIOS, " SIGHED PRINCE ABDULLAHIBN HASSAN, 25, A COUSIN OF THE IMAM . " BUT NONE OF MY MEN KNOW HOW TOUSE THEM . " NOR CAN THEY USE CAPTURED TANKS OR TRUCKS, SINCE NONE OFTHE TRIBESMEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE . WHEN THEY ATTACK A TANK, THETRIBESMEN FIRST KILL OFF THE ACCOMPANYING INFANTRYMEN, THEN OFTEN SETIT AFIRE WITH FLAMING CORN STALKS . THE EGYPTIANS ARE RESTRICTED TO THEFEW ROUGH ROADS AND DEPEND ON DAILY DELIVERY OF SUPPLIES, WHILE THEROYALISTS CAN FIGHT ANYWHERE . SAYS PRINCE ABDULLAH : " ALL MY MENNEED IS BREAD AND BULLETS . WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE ARE ALL DEAD OR THEEGYPTIANS ARE DRIVEN INTO THE SEA . WE BOW ONLY TO GOD . " PLASTEREDSKIRMISHERS . YEMEN'S ROADS AND FIELDS ARE LITTERED WITH THE REMAINS OFDEAD EGYPTIANS LEFT TO ROT UNBURIED . " LET THE DOGS EAT THE EGYPTIANDOGS, " SPAT A TRIBESMAN . THE FEW EGYPTIANS TAKEN PRISONER SEEM DAZEDAND DEJECTED . PRIVATE AMER HUSSEIN BAHID, 24, OF CAIRO, WAS DUE FORFOR DISCHARGEIN JANUARY AFTER THREE YEARS' ARMY SERVICE . INSTEAD, HIS COMPANY WASAIRLIFTED TO SAN'A AND RUSHED OFF TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK AT BEITMIRAN . SAID HE : " ABOUT 25 MILES FROM SAN'A WE WERE AMBUSHED . MYCOMPANY NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO FIGHT . IN A FEW HOURS, MORE THAN 100 OFUS WERE KILLED, AND I SURRENDERED . " NASSER HAS APPARENTLY HAD TO CALLUP THE RESERVES . COMPLAINED SERGEANT IBRAHIM MOHSIN ALKATI, 32, WHOWAS A CAIRO TRUCK MECHANIC BEFORE HE WAS RECALLED TO DUTY : " I DIDN'TEVEN KNOW THERE WAS A WAR ON IN YEMEN . I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TOHELP TRAIN THE YEMENI REPUBLICAN ARMY . " ONE BATTLE WITNESSED BYCORRESPONDENT DE CARVALHO WAS AT EL ARGOUP, 25 MILES SOUTHEAST OFSAN'A, WHERE 500 YEMENIS COMMANDED BY PRINCE ABDULLAH ATTACKED ANEGYPTIAN POSITION ON TOP OF A SHEERSIDED HILL THAT WAS FORTIFIED WITHSIX SOVIET T-54 TANKS, A DOZEN ARMORED CARS AND ENTRENCHED MACHINE GUNS. THE YEMENIS, ADVANCING IN A THIN SKIRMISH LINE, WERE PLASTERED BYARTILLERY, MORTARS AND STRAFING PLANES . THEY COULD REPLY ONLY WITHRIFLES, ONE MORTAR WITH 20 ROUNDS, AND A BAZOOKA WITH FOUR ROUNDSHANDLED BY A MAN WHO HAD NEVER FIRED A BAZOOKA BEFORE IN HIS LIFE . THEFIGHT FOR EL ARGOUP LASTED A WEEK AND ENDED IN A ROUT THAT COST THEEGYPTIANS THREE TANKS, SEVEN ARMORED CARS AND 160 DEAD . DE CARVALHOASKED A HAGGARD SHEIK IF HIS MEN SUFFERED FROM BATTLE FATIGUE . THESHEIK FROWNED : " WE SUFFER FROM MANY DISEASES IN YEMEN, BUT BATTLEFATIGUE WHAT IS THAT ? " THE TRIBESMEN'S LOYALTY TO THE IMAM IS NOTALWAYS EASY TO UNDERSTAND . MANY OF THE PRESENT ROYALIST LEADERSSUFFERED CRUELLY DURING THE 14-YEAR REIGN OF BADR'S FATHER, AHMAD THEDEVIL, WHOSE WAY OF PACIFYING THE HILL TRIBES WAS TO TAKE MASS HOSTAGESAND BEHEAD RESTIVE SHEIKS . SHRUGGED ONE SHEIK : " THE IMAMS HAVERULED US FOR A THOUSAND YEARS . SOME WERE GOOD AND SOME BAD . WE KILLEDTHE BAD ONES SOONER OR LATER, AND WE PROSPERED UNDER THE GOOD ONES . "ANOTHER REASON FOR FIGHTING THE REPUBLICANS IS THAT THE HILL TRIBESBELONG TO THE MOSLEM SHIA SECT, OF WHICH THE IMAM IS THE RELIGIOUS HEAD. THE YEMENIS OF THE COAST AND THE SOUTH BELONG TO THE RIVAL SUNNI SECT(AS DO MOST EGYPTIANS) . THOUGH PRESIDENT SALLAL IS HIMSELF A MOUNTAINSHIA, IT IS HIS MISFORTUNE TO BE FIGHTING THE FIERCE MOUNTAIN SHIASWITH LOWLAND SUNNIS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN FAMED FOR MARTIAL PROWESS . THEIMAM MOHAMMED EL BADR IS A HUSKY, HARD-LOOKING MAN OF 36 WHO ROVESCONSTANTLY ALONG THE NORTHWEST FRONT IN A DODGE WAGON AND NEVER SLEEPSMORE THAN TWO NIGHTS IN THE SAME PLACE . IN A WADI UNDER THE STARS ONENIGHT, HE TOLD DE CARVALHO :. " NASSER'S BIGGEST SINGLE TARGET INYEMEN IS ME . " WAVING AT THE SKIES FROM WHICH EGYPTIAN JETS HADPOUNCED ON HIS FORCES ONLY THAT DAY, HE SIGHED : " NOW I'M GETTING MYREWARD FOR BEFRIENDING NASSER . WE WERE BROTHERS, BUT WHEN I REFUSED TOBECOME HIS STOOGE, HE USED SALLAL AGAINST ME . I WILL NEVER STOPFIGHTING . I WILL NEVER GO INTO EXILE . WIN OR LOSE, MY GRAVE WILL BEHERE . " BY LAST WEEK THE WAR SEEMED DEADLOCKED . HOWEVER, IMAMMOHAMMED IS TRYING TO RECRUIT A MERCENARY AIR FORCE, AND IS BUILDING UPA SMALL STOCK OF ANTITANK GUNS, RECOILLESS RIFLES AND MORTARS . SAUDIARABIA, WHICH HAS BANKROLLED THE ROYALISTS SO FAR WITH ABOUT $15MILLION, IS ITCHING TO PLUNGE INTO THE FIGHT . IN THE WAKE OF REPEATEDBOMBINGS OF SAUDI TOWNS, SAUDI ARABIA'S PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL WARNEDU.S . DIPLOMATS : " I CANNOT SIT MUCH LONGER WITH MY ARMS FOLDED WHILENASSER ATTACKS NOT ONLY MY NEIGHBOR YEMEN BUT ALSO MY OWN COUNTRY . "
