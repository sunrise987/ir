RUSSIA THAT STRANGE TIME I AM NOT RETREATING ONE DAMNED STEP .IT IS GOOD TO BE ANGRY AT UNTRUTH . SO, IN THE FULL FLUSH OFDESTALINIZATION, WROTE EVGENY EVTUSHENKO, 29, THE RUSSIAN POET WHOSEHONEST RAGE AT THE CANT AND CALLOUSNESS OF SOVIET SOCIETY HAS MADE HIMTHE IDOL OF HIS GENERATION . FOR A WHILE, IN FACT, IT SEEMED AS IFEVTUSHENKO (TIME COVER, APRIL 13, 1962) HAD BECOME A SEMIOFFICIAL ANGRYYOUNG MARXIST, WHOSE OCCASIONAL EXCESSES WERE TOLERATED BY THE REGIMEBECAUSE THEY MADE IT APPEAR AS IF KHRUSHCHEV'S COMMUNISM COULD ACTUALLYACCEPT CRITICISM . IF SO, EVTUSHENKO PUSHED HIS LUCK TOO FAR . VAINAPOLOGIES . DURING A SWING THROUGH FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY EARLY THISYEAR, THE DASHING YOUNG POET WAS LIONIZED AT PARTIES (INCLUDING AMASQUERADE BALL DURING MUNICH'S ANNUAL CARNIVAL) BY PLEASURE-LOVINGBOURGEOIS INTELLECTUALS . HE EVEN HELD A SERIES OF FREEWHEELING PRESSCONFERENCES . HEAPING SCORN ON THE PARTY FOSSILS WHOSE HACKWORK WINSTHE STALIN PRIZE EACH YEAR, EVTUSHENKO ACTUALLY BLAMED STALIN'S REIGNOF TERROR ON THE DICTATOR'S " CLOSE ASSOCIATES " OF WHOM, THOUGH HE DIDNOT SAY SO, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV IS THE DEAN EMERITUS . THE POET'S MOSTAUDACIOUS GESTURE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS TO GIVE THE EDITORS OF FRANCE'SL'EXPRESS HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR PUBLICATION, KNOWING WELL THAT NOSOVIET WRITER IS PERMITTED TO PUBLISH ABROAD WITHOUT FIRST GETTINGCLEARANCE FROM THE CENSORS . CUED BY KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF, WHO RECENTLYRAPPED EVTUSHENKO FOR " CHEAP SENSATIONALISM, " A THREE-DAY MEETING OFTHE UNION OF SOVIET WRITERS LAST MONTH ADDRESSED ITSELF ALMOSTEXCLUSIVELY TO DESTROYING THE CULT OF EVTUSHENKO . IN ALL, CLOSE TO 40TAME AUTHORS TROOPED MONOTONOUSLY FORWARD TO DENOUNCE EVTUSHENKO ANDOTHER LIBERAL YOUNG WRITERS FOR OFFENSES RANGING FROM BAD RHYMES TO "SACRILGEIOUS STATEMENTS " ABOUT THE REVOLUTION . THOUGH EVTUSHENKO MADEABJECT APOLOGIES FOR HIS " IRREVOCABLE MISTAKE, " THE DRUMFIRE OFCRITICISM ONLY GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSISTENT . MUTTER IN MINSK . LASTWEEK THE SOVIET PRESS FUMED THAT EVTUSHENKO AND OTHER YOUNG WRITERSSHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ABROAD UNTIL THEY " MATURE POLITICALLY. " WHEN A WEST GERMAN GIRL WAS DETAINED AT THE SOVIET BORDER ONCHARGES OF SMUGGLING CAVIAR, IZVESTIA BROUGHT EVTUSHENKO INTO IT BYCHARGING THAT SHE HAD MET EVTUSHENKO IN GERMANY AND FROM HIM HADLEARNED ALL ABOUT " FASHIONABLE MOSCOW YOUTH . " IN MINSK, WHERE DMITRYSHOSTAKOVICH'S NEW 13TH SYMPHONY WAS PERFORMED FOR THE FIRST TIMEOUTSIDE MOSCOW, A CRITIC CASTIGATED THE COMPOSER FOR BASING PART OF HISSCORE ON EVTUSHENKO'S FAMED POEM, BABI YAR, A SAVAGE INDICTMENT OFSOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM THAT THE LITERARY COMMISSARS HAVE ALREADY MADEEVTUSHENKO REVISE . THOUGH KHRUSHCHEV WAS PLAINLY OUT TO MAKEEVTUSHENKO THE SCAPEGOAT, THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE POET WAS ONLY PARTOF A NEW, SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO CLAMP STRICT PARTY CONTROLS ON THETHEATER, MUSIC, ART, BOOK PUBLISHING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, AND EVERYOTHER FIELD IN WHICH YOUNG COMMUNISTS MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO VOICEINDEPENDENT THOUGHTS . IT WAS ONCE MORE THAT " STRANGE TIME, " ASEVTUSHENKO WROTE IN 1960, " WHEN COMMON INTEGRITY COULD BE CALLEDCOURAGE . /
