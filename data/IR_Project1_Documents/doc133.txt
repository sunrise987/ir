THE ALLIES TEMPTATION OF TRADE PIPE THE BIG KIND THAT RUSSIADESPERATELY NEEDS TO COMPLETE ITS VAST GAS AND OIL NETWORK STRETCHINGFROM THE PACIFIC TO THE ELBE WAS THE SECOND BIGGEST TOPIC IN EUROPEANCAPITALS LAST WEEK . FOR MONTHS, NATO HAS BEEN URGING A TOTAL EMBARGOON LARGE-DIAMETER PIPE . SPUTTERED A NATO OFFICIAL IN PARIS : " SELLTHEM RIFLES . EVEN SELL THEM ATOMIC BOMBS . BUT DON'T SELL THEM PIPE ./ PROVOKING THE OUTCRY WAS A RUMBLE THAT STARTED IN BONN FORTNIGHT AGOWHEN REBELLIOUS MEMBERS OF THE BUNDESTAG ROUNDED UP ENOUGH VOTES TOREVERSE THE GOVERNMEN'T CANCELLATION OF A JUICY $20 MILLION SOVIET PIPEORDER . CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER RUSHED BACK HOME FROM A LAKE COMOVACATION ON THE EVE OF THE BALLOTING, MANAGED TO AVOID HUMILIATINGDEFEAT ONLY BY ORDERING HIS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS TO STAY OFF THE FLOOR,THUS CAUSING THE LACK OF A QUORUM . DER ALTE'S LAST-DITCH MANEUVERPROVED HIS SOLID SUPPORT OF THE U.S., WHICH, UNLIKE MOST OF ITS ALLIES,ATTACHES GREAT STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE TO MOSCOW'S PIPELINE NETWORK .BUT IT GOT ADENAUER INTO TROUBLE AT HOME . THE PRO-NATO SOCIALISTSCALLED THE BUNDESTAG BOYCOTT DIRTY POOL ; THE INDUSTRIALISTSCOMPLAINED MORE BITTERLY THAN EVER . THERE THE ISSUE COULD HAVESIMMERED INDEFINITELY ; BUT LAST WEEK THE BRITISH CALMLY ANNOUNCEDTHAT, SINCE THEY HAD NEVER SUPPORTED NATO'S PIPE EMBARGO IN THE FIRSTPLACE, THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO OBJECTION IF A BRITISH FIRM ACCEPTED ASOVIET DEAL FOR PIPE THAT BONN HAD JUST CANCELED . THAT ONLY ONEBRITISH COMPANY WAS TECHNICALLY EQUIPPED TO TURN OUT SMALL AMOUNTS OFLARGE-DIAMETER PIPE AND HAD NOT EVEN RECEIVED A BID FROM MOSCOW WAS OFSMALL COMFORT TO U.S . AND WEST GERMAN OFFICIALS . NOR WERE THEYREASSURED BY THE FACT THAT ITALY, A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF SOVIET PIPEBEFORE THE NATO BAN, DID NOT IMMEDIATELY GRAB OFF PART OF THE LUCRATIVETRADE ; ITALIAN MANUFACTURERS SIMPLY WERE BACKED UP AT THE MOMENT WITHTHEIR OWN DOMESTIC ORDERS . WHAT REALLY HAD WASHINGTON AND BONNCONCERNED WAS LONDON'S NEXT MOVE . BRITAIN, EXCLUDED FOR NOW FROM THECOMMON MARKET AND PLAGUED BY SERIOUS UNEMPLOYMENT, WAS EAGER FOR EXPORTMARKETS ANYWHERE ; IF ONE INCH OF LARGE-DIAMETER OIL PIPE WASDELIVERED TO RUSSIA, THE NATO BOYCOTT WOULD BE BROKEN . WEST GERMANYAND ITALY COULD NO LONGER BE RESTRAINED . NEITHER COULD FRANCE, WHICHHAS A MASSIVE (500,000 TONS), AND MOSTLY UNUSED, ANNUAL CAPACITY FORPIPE PRODUCTION, BUT WHICH SUPPORTS THE U.S . COMPLETELY ON THE ALLIES'DEBATE OVER THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF MOSCOW'S BIG INCH .
