AFTER ALL, SIX OF THE SEVEN "JUDGES " WERE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT DIA HAD TRIED TODISSOLVE BY FORCE DURING THE ABORTIVE COUP . THEY JUST MIGHT BE ALITTLEPREJUDICED . BUT WHEN THE PROCEEDINGS BEGAN, THE COURT WAS CAREFUL TOOBSERVE ALL THE FLOWERY DECORUM OF GALLIC JUSTICE . THE PRESIDING JUDGEWAS RESPLENDENT IN ERMINETRIMMED LONG RED ROBES, AND SAT LISTENING WITHCALM DIGNITY . MOREOVER, DIA WAS NOT EVEN CHARGED WITH " PLOTTING, "ONLY WITH THE MORE VAGUE " ACTING AGAINST THE INTERNAL SECURITY OF THESTATE . " TAKING THE FLOOR IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, DIA ARGUED THAT HE WASNOT GUILTY OF THE CHARGES . WHEN HE SENT GENDARMES TO OVERTHROWPRESIDENT LEOPOLD SENGHOR AND ARREST PRO-SENGHOR DEPUTIES, DIA SAID, HEWAS ONLY TRYING TO HEAD OFF A PLOT AGAINST HIMSELF THAT STEMMED FROMHIS EFFORTS TO CRACK SENEGAL'S PEANUT MONOPOLISTS . CRIED DIA : " IWANTED A CONSTITUTIONAL SOLUTION, THEY (SENGHOR'S MEN) WANTED APOLITICAL ONE . " IN REPLY, THE PROSECUTOR SOUNDED DOWNRIGHTSYMPATHETIC . THERE WERE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, HE AGREED ; DIAWAS OBVIOUSLY A MISGUIDED PATRIOT WHO " THOUGHT THAT ONE COULD NOT BE AGOOD SENEGALESE WHEN ONE WAS AGAINST MAMADOU DIA . " BUT AT WEEK'S ENDTHE COURT GAVELED AN END TO COURTLINESS . AFTER TWO HOURS AND 15MINUTES OF DELIBERATION, THE JUSTICES SENTENCED DIA TO THE MAXIMUMPENALTY, LIFE IMPRISONMENT .
