LAOS EVIL SPIRITS ON THE PLAIN JUST A YEAR AFTER THE GENEVAAGREEMENT CONSOLIDATED LAOS' THREE WARRING FACTIONS INTO A SINGLEGOVERNMENT, THE PRECARIOUS ARRANGEMENT IS FALLING APART . REASON : THECOMMUNISTS ARE SIMPLY IGNORING THE TRUCE, AS WELL AS THEIR LONGTIMEALLIANCE WITH NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA, AND ARE SEEKING TOWREST CONTROL OF THE VITAL PLAIN OF JARS IN CENTRAL LAOS FROMNEUTRALIST TROOPS . THOUGH AT FIRST SUSPICIOUS OF THE NEUTRALISTREGIME, RIGHTIST GENERAL PHOUMI NOSAVAN SENT FOUR BATTALIONS TO HELP IT. DESPITE SUCH ASSISTANCE, THE NEUTRALIST FORCES UNDER GENERAL KONG LEHAVE ONLY ONE STRATEGIC POSITION LEFT ON THE PLAIN PHOU THENENGMOUNTAIN AND ITS FOOTHILLS . LAST WEEK THE COMMUNIST PATHET LAO OPENEDA HEAVY ARTILLERY BARRAGE ON KONG LE'S POSITION . " AT FIRST, THECOMMUNISTS WERE VERY GOOD TO US AND GAVE US SUPPLIES, " SAYS THE LITTLEGENERAL . " BUT NOW I KNOW THE PATHET LAO ARE NOT FIGHTING FOR LAOS BUTFOR COMMUNISM . WE DO NOT WANT LAOS TO BE CONTROLLED BY ANYONE, NOT THECOMMUNISTS OR THE AMERICANS . " OLD BATTLE SCAR . IN HIS OLIVE-DRABHEADQUARTERS TENT ON THE PLAIN OF JARS, WEARING A T SHIRT, A PAIR OFLEVI'S AND RUBBER BATH SHOES, KONG LE PERCHES ON A STOOL MOROSELYSTUDYING A MAP BENEATH THE LIGHT OF A SWAYING HURRICANE LAMP . THEPICTURE IS DISCOURAGING : THE PATHET LAO ARE ADVANCING IN THE VANGVIENG AREA, 13 NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS ARE MISSING AFTER AN ACTION AT BANBOUA, A 100-TRUCK RED SUPPLY CONVOY FROM NORTH VIET NAM ARRIVED AT THEPATHET LAO HEADQUARTERS AT KHANG KHAY . AT SUCH NEWS, KONG LE IS APT TOWINCE, RUB AN OLD BATTLE SCAR ON HIS FOREHEAD AND SAY : " MY HEADHURTS . " THEN HE USUALLY TAKES SOME PILLS, AND A BODYGUARD TREATS HISSHOULDER WITH VICKS OINTMENT . WHILE THE NEUTRALISTS ARE INCREASINGLY "NEUTRAL " AGAINST THE REDS, PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA CONTINUES TO INSISTON A DEFENSIVE WAR, IS RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE . " WHAT CAN IDO ? " MUSES KONG LE DESPONDENTLY . " THE PREMIER IS ALWAYS TELLINGME I MUST NOT ATTACK . IT IS VERY DIFFICULT . " LOCKED BRIEFCASES .KONG LE IS A MAGNET FOR SOME OF THE MOST IDEALISTIC MEN IN LAOS . SHORT(5 FT . 1 IN., 115 LBS.), QUIET AND GOOD-NATURED, HE NEITHER DRINKS,SMOKES NOR GAMBLES AND IS FANATIC ABOUT HEALTH, HONESTY AND CLEANLINESS. HE SHARES COMMON LAOTIAN SUPERSTITIONS, SUCH AS WEARING A " MAGIC "RING AND A WRIST AMULET TO PLACATE THE PHI (SPIRITS, EVIL OR OTHERWISE). WITHOUT PERSONAL AMBITION, KONG LE SAYS THAT " WHEN LAOS IS FREE, "HE WILL GO HOME TO HIS VILLAGE AND BECOME A FARMER . IN THE FIELD, HESHARES HIS TENT WITH THREE OFFICERS AND FOUR ENLISTED MEN . THEY MESSTOGETHER AROUND A CAMPFIRE, SING SAD LAOTIAN SONGS OR DANCE THEGRACEFUL LAMVONG, WHILE KONG LE, HOLDING TWO PET HAMSTERS IN HIS LAP,LOOKS ON . HIS POSSESSIONS ARE FEW : A DESK, A FOOTLOCKER, ATRANSISTOR RADIO (GIFT FROM THE U.S . AMBASSADOR), AND FIVE LOCKEDBRIEFCASES, WHICH HE KEEPS UNDER HIS BUNK . OCCASIONALLY HE UNLOCKS ONETO TAKE OUT NOT CONFIDENTIAL PAPERS BUT A HANDKERCHIEF AND A PAIR OFSOCKS, AND THEN CAREFULLY RELOCKS IT . WHILE ADMITTING HIS LEADERSHIPQUALITIES, WESTERN OBSERVERS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED BY KONG LE'S LAOTIANINDIFFERENCE TO DISCIPLINE AND LOGISTICS . ALTHOUGH SUPPLIES AREAIRLIFTED TO THE NEUTRALISTS BY FIVE U.S.-LOANED C-46S FROM VIENTIANE,TRUCKS AND JEEPS BREAK DOWN FOR LACK OF PARTS . AMMUNITION DUMPS ARELEFT UNGUARDED AND OPEN TO WEATHER . NEUTRALIST OFFICERS TALK TO EACHOTHER " IN THE CLEAR " ON FIELD RADIOS, LEAVE MARKED MAPS LYING AROUND,AND DRIVE AT NIGHT WITH HEADLIGHTS BLAZING . THE SUPPLY SYSTEM IS SOHAPHAZARD THAT OFTEN ONE UNIT OVERFLOWS WITH RICE RATIONS BUT LACKSBULLETS, WHILE ANOTHER IS LOADED WITH MUNITIONS BUT STARVES . NONE OFTHE NEUTRALIST TROOPS HAVE BEEN PAID IN ALMOST A YEAR . SAYS KONG LE :/ MY MEN ARE TIRED, BUT THEIR MORALE IS HIGH, AND THEY STILL HAVE THEWILL TO FIGHT . " LONG SILENCE . THEY DEMONSTRATED THAT WILL, IN ALAOTIAN WAY, JUST TWO RIDGES BEYOND KONG LE'S HEADQUARTERS . OVER THEVELVETY LANDSCAPE AND THROUGH SOFT SUMMER RAIN ROLLED TWO TANKS AND ANARMORED CAR CROWDED WITH NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS . THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS APATHET LAO ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENT ON TOP OF A STEEP, CONICAL HILL . ASTHE TANKS CHUGGED UP THE FIRST RISE, A HERD OF WILD PONIES STAMPEDEDAWAY FROM THEM . ONE TANK AND THE ARMORED CAR SOON HALTED, BUT THESECOND TANK LABORED UPWARD, FOLLOWED BY A SKIRMISH LINE OF SCRAMBLINGSOLDIERS . MOMENTS LATER, THE PATHET LAO GUN FLASHED, AND THE TANKFIRED BACK . BOTH MISSED . IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTGUN COULD NOT BE DEPRESSED SUFFICIENTLY TO GET THE TANK IN ITS SIGHTS .EVEN SO, BOTH SIDES FIRED FUTILELY FOR TWO HOURS . THEN THE TANKRUMBLED AROUND A SIDE OF THE HILL, AND THE NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS VANISHEDAMONG THE TREES . A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED . THE PALE SUN SHONE THROUGHSHOWERS, AND ARAINBOW BRIEFLY APPEARED OVER THE PURPLEMOUNTAINS . TWO OF THE WILD PONIES RETURNEDAND BEGAN GRAZING . THE BATTLE SIMPLYBLURRED INTO THE GENERAL DRIFT OF EVENTS IN LAOS .
