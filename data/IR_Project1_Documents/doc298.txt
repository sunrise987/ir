ALL THREE OF THE MEN ON TRIAL, LONGTIME EMPLOYEESOF GEHLEN, WERE ALSO LONGTIME EMPLOYEES OF THE SOVIET UNION . BY ALLODDS, IT WAS THE MOST EMBARRASSING SPY SCANDAL TO HIT WEST GERMANYSINCE THE WAR . " I HATE AMERICANS . " EX-WEHRMACHT GENERAL REINHARDGEHLEN, WHO IS AS SECRETIVE AS ANY OF HIS 5,000 MEN (HIS LAST KNOWNPHOTOGRAPH DATES FROM 1944), SET UP HIS OUTFIT IN 1947 WITH THECOOPERATION OF THE CIA . IT WAS STAFFED LARGELY WITH VETERAN AGENTS WHOGOT THEIR TRAINING UNDER THE NAZIS, ALTHOUGH GEHLEN HIMSELF HAD NEVERJOINED THE NAZI PARTY . IN 1955 THE GEHLEN APPARATUS WAS TURNED OVERFROM CIA CONTROL TO THE WEST GERMAN GOVERNMENT ; IT REPORTS DIRECTLYTO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE, HAS A TOP SECRET BUDGET . YET IN COURT, THETHREE MEN WHO PENETRATED ITS WALLED-IN MUNICH HEADQUARTERS MADE THEFEAT SOUND ABOUT AS DIFFICULT AS JOINING A BAVARIAN MARCHING ANDGYMNASTIC SOCIETY . FIRST OF THE TRIO TO FACE THE FIVE REDROBED JUDGESAT KARLSRUHE WAS STOCKY HANS CLEMENS, 61, WHO PEERED WITH INTEREST ATAN EXHIBIT TABLE COVERED WITH THE TOOLS OF HIS TRADE : CAMERAS, TAPERECORDERS, MICROSCOPES, RADIOS, FILMS AND SUITCASES WITH SECRETCOMPARTMENTS . AS HE TOLD IT, CLEMENS HAD BEEN A PIANIST AS A YOUTH INDRESDEN, BUT CHANGED KEYS AND BECAME A NAZI POLICE OFFICIAL IN 1933 .HE HEADED THE DRESDEN OFFICE OF THE DREADED SS SECURITY SERVICE .DURING WORLD WAR II HE COMMANDED AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN ITALY THATKILLED 330 HOSTAGES AND FOR HIS SAVAGERY WON THE TITLE " THE TIGER OFCOMO . " BACK IN GERMANY AFTER THE WAR, HE MET A COLONEL " MAX " OFSOVIET INTELLIGENCE, WHO SUGGESTED THAT HE GET A JOB WITH THE GEHLENORGANIZATION . IT PROVED EASY . THE MOTIVE HE GAVE FOR BECOMING ADOUBLE AGENT FOR THE REDS SEEMED LIKE AN OLD PROPAGANDA BROADCAST . " IHATE AMERICANS LIKE THE PLAGUE, " HE SAID IN COURT, RECALLING THATAFTER AMERICAN AIR RAIDS ON DRESDEN HE HAD SWORN, " I SHALL REPAY THEMDOUBLY AND TRIPLY . " CHAMPAGNE IN STREAMS . ONE MAJOR SERVICE CLEMENSPERFORMED FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS TO RECRUIT A FORMER SS COLLEAGUE, HEINZFELFE . COOL AND ARTICULATE, DEFENDANT FELFE, 45, TOLD THE JUDGES THATHE TOO WAS AN ARDENT NAZI, HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP INTO HEINRICHHIMMLER'S STATE SECURITY BUREAU . HE BRAGGED OF HIS WARTIME SUCCESSES,WHICH HE CLAIMED INCLUDED GETTING FIRST REPORTS ON TEHERAN AND YALTAFROM A CONFIDANT OF ALLEN DULLES . AFTER WAR'S END HE WAS CLASSIFIED BYA GERMAN DENAZIFICATION BOARD AS UNBELASTET (NOT INCRIMINATED) . THISASTONISHING FACT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY PRESIDING JUDGE KURT WEBER WITH ANOUTRAGED " DONNERWETTER ! " (THUNDERATION) . IN 1947, JUST 18 MONTHSAFTER FELFE'S RELEASE FROM A PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP, HE FOUND SPY WORKWITH THE BRITISH, CONTINUING WITH THEM UNTIL, AS HE PUT IT, THE BRITISH/ RAN OUT OF MONEY . " THEN HIS OLD FRIEND CLEMENS MADE CONTACT WITHHIM ON ORDERS FROM COLONEL " MAX, " ARRANGED A MEETING IN EAST BERLIN,AT WHICH FELFE WAS HIRED TO WORK FOR THE SOVIETS . THE DEAL WASCLINCHED AT A DINNER AT MAX'S VILLA, WHERE THE TABLE " WAS PILED HIGHWITH FOOD AND CHAMPAGNE POURED IN STREAMS . " NOT LONG AFTERWARD,THANKS TO A RECOMMENDATION FROM HIS FRIEND CLEMENS, FELFE WAS OFFERED AJOB IN THE GEHLEN SERVICE . " NOW, " HE SAID, " I WAS TO DANCE AT TWOWEDDINGS, WITH THE RUSSIANS AND WITH GEHLEN . " FELFE DANCED UP FAST INGEHLEN'S RANKS, AND BY THE TIME OF HIS ARREST IN 1961 HAD BECOME ADEPARTMENT HEAD IN THE COUNTER-ESPIONAGE DIVISION, SPECIALIZING INANTI-SOVIET WORK . REWARDING INVESTMENT . THE WORRIEDLOOKING THIRDMEMBER OF THE GROUP, ONE ERWIN TIEBEL, MERELY SERVED AS COURIER FORFELFE AND CLEMENS . THE SPIES TRANSMITTED THEIR INFORMATION BYMICROFILM HIDDEN IN FOOD CANS SENT TO EAST GERMANY, BY DROPS ALONG THEAUTOBAHN, AND BY FREQUENT TRIPS ON U.S . AIR FORCE COURIER FLIGHTS TOBERLIN, WHICH THEY BOARDED UNDER THE PRETEXT OF BEING ON GEHLENBUSINESS, THE THREE GOT A TOTAL OF $78,000 FROM MOSCOW . FOR THEINVESTMENT,THE SOVIETS GOT 15,000 MICROFILM PHOTOGRAPHS OF WEST GERMANINTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS, 20 SPOOLS OF TAPE RECORDINGS, NUMEROUS VERBALAND RADIO REPORTS, INCLUDING THE IDENTITY OF MANY WEST GERMAN AGENTSWORKING BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN . AS THE TESTIMONY POURED FORTH, THEOUTCRY FROM WEST GERMANY'S PRESS AND PUBLIC FORCED DEFENSE MINISTERKAIUWE VON HASSEL TO PROMISE A " RE-EXAMINATION " OF GEHLEN'SORGANIZATION, AND REPORTEDLY GEHLEN WILL RETIRE SOON . VON HASSEL ADDEDLAMELY : " THERE WILL ALWAYS BE CASES OF INFILTRATION IN ANYINTELLIGENCE SERVICE . " BUT THE GEHLEN GROUP MUST HAVE SET A RECORD OFSORTS . AT ONE POINT, TESTIFIED FELFE, HIS RUSSIAN BOSSES URGED HIM TOGET A TRANSFER BECAUSE THERE ALREADY WAS A SURPLUS OF SOVIET AGENTS INHIS DEPARTMENT . SHORTLY BEFORE THEIR ARREST, ADDED FELFE, HE ANDCLEMENS RECEIVED LETTERS OF COMMENDATION AND CASH BONUSES FROM THECHAIRMAN OF THE SOVIET COMMITTEE FOR STATE SECURITY.SIMULTANEOUSLY, THETWO AGENTS GOT CITATIONS FOR TEN YEARS' MERITORIOUS SERVICE FROMGENERAL GEHLEN .
