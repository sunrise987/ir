RUSSIA BETTER THINGS FOR BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY ? /UTOPIANS THINK THAT SCIENCE CAN TRANSFORM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN INTOLEMONADE, " SNORTED KARL MARX'S CO-WORKER, FRIEDRICH ENGELS . YET WHOSHOULD BE SERVING UP LEMONADE LAST WEEK THAN THAT OLD REALIST NIKITAKHRUSHCHEV . IN THE KREMLIN'S MARBLE-HALLED PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES,ADDRESSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND MORE THAN 5,000OTHER COMRADES, NIKITA PROMISED THAT ONE GREAT FORCE WOULD MIRACULOUSLYSTRAIGHTEN OUT THE SOVIET ECONOMIC MESS : BIG CHEMISTRY . BETWEEN 1964AND 1970, KHRUSHCHEV ANNOUNCED, THE REGIME WILL SPEND $46 BILLION TOEXPAND THE SOVIET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT THAT NOW GOESANNUALLY INTO ALL DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . WHERE WOULD THEADDITIONAL MONEY COME FROM ? KHRUSHCHEV HINTED AT A RADICAL REDUCTIONIN MILITARY SPENDING . MORE IMPORTANT, HE ADMITTED THAT RUSSIA WOULDNEED CREDIT AND SUPPLIES, INCLUDING ENTIRE FACTORIES, FROM THE WEST BUTNOT, HE FUMED, AT " FABULOUS PROFITS " TO THE CAPITALISTS . BRAVE TALK. PLANS CALL FOR BUILDING 200 NEW PLANTS AND MODERNIZING 500 OLD ONES; SINCE MUCH OF THE NEW PRODUCTION WILL BE PLASTICS AND SYNTHETICFIBERS, SOVIET CITIZENS MAY AT LAST FIND IT EASIER TO BUY SUCH SIMPLEITEMS AS NYLON STOCKINGS AND LINOLEUM FLOORING . " FOR THE FIRST TIMEIN ALL THE 46 YEARS OF SOVIET POWER, " SAID NIKITA IN A REMARKABLECONFESSION, THE PARTY AND THE STATE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT " SATISFYINGTHE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PEOPLE . " MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS MUST SHOWBETTER DESIGN, BECAUSE IT IS " NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO TOLERATE " RUSSIANCONSUMER GOODS THAT " LOOK LESS SMART THAN FOREIGN ARTICLES . " AN EVENMORE URGENT TASK FOR BIG CHEMISTRY IS THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICALFERTILIZER . ITS OUTPUT, PROMISED KHRUSHCHEV, WOULD BE QUADRUPLED FROM20 MILLION TONS THIS YEAR TO 80 MILLION TONS BY 1970 . THIS WOULDPERMIT RUSSIA TO CATCH UP WITH THE U.S., FOR U.S . FARM SURPLUSES ARENOT THE RESULT OF ANY " SPECIAL AMERICAN WISDOM, " KHRUSHCHEV INSISTED; IT IS JUST THAT THE U.S . USES ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH FERTILIZER ASTHE SOVIET UNION ON ABOUT HALF THE ACREAGE . THROUGH ALL THIS BRAVETALK RAN THE ADMISSION OF RUSSIA'S DISASTROUS AGRICULTURAL FAILURES .ONE ARRESTING FIGURE : ALTHOUGH ACREAGE INCREASED 7 PER CENT SINCELAST YEAR, YIELD ACTUALLY DROPPED 20 PER CENT . IF ANYONE WAS INCLINEDTO CRITICIZE THIS FAILURE, OR THE COSTLY PALLIATIVE OF BUYING GRAINFROM THE WEST, KHRUSHCHEV HAD THE STANDARD ANSWER . REMEMBER HOWBAD THINGSWERE UNDER STALIN . IN 1947, TO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, STALIN ANDMOLOTOV ACTUALLY SOLD GRAIN ABROAD WHILE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS " PEOPLEHAD BLOATED STOMACHS OR EVEN DIED FROM LACK OF FOOD . " IT WAS THEFIRST TIME MOSCOW HAD ADMITTED THAT STARVATION TOOK PLACE IN THE SOVIETUNION SINCE THE FORCED COLLECTIVIZATION OF THE EARLY 1930S . BULGINGWAREHOUSES . FOLLOWING KHRUSHCHEV'S 4F-HOUR SPEECH, OTHER COMMUNISTBIGWIGS SHOOK THE AUDIENCE WITH A SERIES OF ANGRY COMPLAINTS . MOSTCOLLECTIVE FARMERS DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT USING CHEMICALFERTILIZER ; THE UKRAINE IS PLANNING A CRASH PROGRAM TO EDUCATE 4,000/ SKILLED FERTILIZER APPLIERS . " SUPERPHOSPHATE FERTILIZER ARRIVES ATTHE FARMS WITH ONLY 20 PER CENT OF THE REQUIRED CHEMICAL NUTRIENTS ;THE REST IS WORTHLESS BALLAST THAT GETS LUMPY AND HEAVY IN THE RAIN .RUSSIA HAS AN IMPRESSIVE 561 SOIL LABORATORIES, BUT MOST OF THEM HAVEONLY ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES AND THE WRONG EQUIPMENT . AS FOR THE CHEMICALINDUSTRY ITSELF, MANAGERS ARE STILL WAITING FOR DELIVERY OF EQUIPMENTDESIGNED TEN YEARS AGO . SOME OF THE PRODUCTS ARE SO UNGAINLY THAT THEYPILE UP UNSOLD IN WAREHOUSES FOR INSTANCE, SYNTHETIC FUR COATS, WHICH,COMPLAINED ONE SPEAKER, " ARE SO HEAVY THAT ONLY WELL-TRAINED ATHLETESCAN WEAR THEM . " ONLY ABOUT 30 PER CENT OF THE WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRYARE ENGAGED IN PRODUCTION, WHILE THE REST ARE OCCUPIED WITH MAINTENANCEOR BUREAUCRATIC TASKS . MOREOVER, WORKERS ARE UNDERPAID AND RECEIVEONLY A FRACTION OF THE PRESCRIBED INCENTIVE BONUSES . THE MATTER OFPERSONAL INCENTIVES WAS CLEARLY THE KEY TO THE SITUATION, BOTH ININDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE . IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF COLLECTIVE FARMINGNOT THE RELATIVELY SUPERFICIAL PROBLEM OF FERTILIZER PRODUCTION THATACCOUNTS FOR THE CHRONIC CRISIS . AS KHRUSHCHEV'S OWN FIGURES SHOWED,PEASANTS WORKING ON THEIR TINY, PRIVATE HALF-ACRE PLOTS, WHICH COMPRISELESS THAN 1 PER CENT OF THE ARABLE LAND, SELL TO THE STATE 14 PER CENTOF THE COUNTRY'S MEAT, 30 PER CENT OF THE EGGS, AND RAISE 65 PER CENTOF THE CABBAGES AND POTATOES .
