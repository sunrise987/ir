IN 1845, BEFORE THE POTATO FAMINE DECIMATED ITSPOPULATION, IRELAND WAS WESTERN EUROPE'S MOST DENSELY SETTLED COUNTRY; SINCE THEN, ITS 9,000,000 INHABITANTS HAVE DWINDLED TO 2,824,000 .IRELAND IS THE ONLY NATION IN EUROPE WHOSE POPULATION HAS SHRUNK INTHAT TIME . WHILE IRISHMEN LEFT THE COUNTRY IN WAVES, THEY ENTERED ITIN A TRICKLE, FOR IRELAND HAS THE LOWEST MARRIAGE RATE, AND ONE OF THELOWEST BIRTH RATES, IN ALL EUROPE . TO THE NEO-MALTHUSIAN, THE IRISHWOULD SEEM MODELS OF ECOLOGICAL BALANCE . IN A COUNTRY WHERE FOODPRODUCTION IS BARELY INCREASING, 66 PER CENT OF ALL IRISH MALES BETWEEN20 AND 39 ARE BACHELORS, AND VAST NUMBERS OF MEN AND WOMEN DIE SINGLE ./ HOLY IRELAND . " THE EXODUS FROM IRELAND, WHICH NOVELIST GEORGE MOOREIRONICALLY JUSTIFIED BY CALLING IRELAND " A FATAL DISEASE " FROM WHICH/ IT IS THE PLAIN DUTY OF EVERY IRISHMAN TO DISSOCIATE HIMSELF, "CONTINUED AFTER THE COUNTRY WON ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITAIN IN 1921 .AS IN MOST OTHER NEWLY LIBERATED COUNTRIES, THE MEN WHO TOOK OVER WEREROMANTIC REVOLUTIONARY HEROES, STEEPED IN THE OTHERWORLD BUT ILLPREPARED BY EXPERIENCE TO MEET THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES OF BUILDING AMODERN NATION .

IRELAND, AFTER ALL, WAS A DIVIDEDCOUNTRY FOR DECADES BEFORE SUCH LATECOMERS TO PARTITION AS GERMANY,KOREA AND VIET NAM .

IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT,UNIVERSITIES AND PUBS, THERE IS A NEW SENSE OF PURPOSE AND PUSH, AMOUNTING AWARENESS THAT IRELAND HAS FINALLY BEGUN TO MAKE ITS WAY INTHE WORLD . AFTER FOUR DECADES OF BROODY ISOLATION, AND SEEMINGLYPRO-GERMAN NEUTRALITY IN WORLD WAR II (ALTHOUGH IN THEIR CONTRARY WAY,MANY IRISH VOLUNTEERED FOR THE BRITISH ARMY), A NEWLY OUTWARD-LOOKINGIRELAND HAS ACQUIRED INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TOITS SIZE OR POLITICAL POWER .

AS THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MOST TO END HIS COUNTRY'SLONG SLEEP, SEAN LEMASS GOT HIS CHANCE WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS TAOISEACHIN 1959 . DE VALERA, NEAR-BLIND AND DOGGEDLY INDIFFERENT TO THECOUNTRY'S WORSENING ECONOMIC PLIGHT, WAS PERSUADED BY HIS OWN FIANNAFAIL PARTY TO STEP ASIDE FOR LEMASS AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY . HISSUCCESSOR, AFTER 19 YEARS AS MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, WASPASSIONATELY CONVINCED THAT IRELAND'S TIMOROUS PROTECTIONISM COULD ONLYLEAD TO NATIONAL EXTINCTION . AS FIANNA FAIL'S NEW LEADER, LEMASS WASTHE ANTITHESIS OF ALL THE OLD FIRE-BREATHING HEROES, TALKED TRADE ANDTARIFFS TO THE VOTERS IN INTENSE, RAPID-FIRE SENTENCES THAT MANY FOUNDHARD TO FOLLOW . " THAT LEMASS ! " SNORTED ONE DUBIOUS DUBLINPOLITICIAN . " HE COULDN'T LEAD IRELAND OVER O'CONNELL BRIDGE . " WHATSEAN LEMASS WANTED MOST WAS TO LURE FOREIGN INVESTORS OVER O'CONNELLBRIDGE . THE NEW PRIME MINISTER SENT BLARNEY-BLESSED SALESMEN AROUNDTHE WORLD PERSUADING FOREIGN INDUSTRIES TO SET UP PLANTS IN IRELAND .THEY OFFERED ONE OF THE FEW LABOR SURPLUSES IN ALL EUROPE, LIBERALGRANTS FOR EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION, AND ADDITIONAL CASH TO COMPANIESTHAT WOULD BUILD PLANTS AND TRAIN WORKERS IN IRELAND'S PINCHEDNORTHWEST AND SOUTH .A TRIBE IN NORTH KATANGA THAT AMBUSHED AN IRISH CONTINGENTIN !960, KILLING TEN OF ITS SOLDIERS .MANY IRISHMEN WERE PROFANELY SKEPTICAL, BUT THEPROGRAM SO FAR HAS PROVED A GALLIVANTING SUCCESS . IRELAND TODAY IS INTHE THROES OF A BELATED INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT IS BOOSTING LIVINGSTANDARDS, DIVERSIFYING ITS FARM-BASED ECONOMY, AND WILL INCREASINGLYABSORB THE TALENTS THAT THE NATION BREEDS . SINCE 1955, 160 NEW IRISHAND FOREIGN-BACKED PLANTS HAVE CREATED 21,000 NEW JOBS AND ARE TURNINGOUT GOODS RANGING FROM TRANSISTOR RADIOS (JAPANESE) AND PIANOS (DUTCH)TO HEAVY CRANES FOR A GERMAN COMPANY AND OIL HEATERS FOR A FRENCH FIRM. FIFTY MORE PLANTS ARE NEARING COMPLETION, MOST NOTABLY A FRENCH-OWNEDAVIATION FACTORY TO TURN OUT A NEW, SHORT-HAUL PLANE AIMED SPECIFICALLYAT U.S . FEEDER AIRLINES . THE SHINY NEW PLANTS IN SHANNON, CORK,LIMERICK, DUBLIN AND KILLARNEY ( " JUST LIKE THE BLACK FOREST, " SAYS AWEST GERMAN INDUSTRIALIST WHO HAS BUILT A FACTORY THERE) HAVE WORKED NOECONOMIC MIRACLE IN IRELAND TO COMPARE WITH EUROPE'S BOOM . BUTINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS RISEN 20 PER CENT IN THREE YEARS . AND ITSSUCCESS IS STANCHING THE POPULATION OUTFLOW : FROM AN AVERAGE OF43,000 A YEAR, THE NUMBER OF EMIGRANTS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 50 PER CENTLAST YEAR, IS EXPECTED TO TOTAL ONLY 14,000 IN 1963 . MANY EMIGRANTSARE NOW RETURNING TO TAKE JOBS BACK HOME . FOUR RS . TODAY'S EXPANSIONWOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF SEAN LEMASS HAD NOT STARTED LAYING THEGROUNDWORK LONG AGO . LEMASS IS THE GREAT-GRANDSON OF A HATTER WHOLANDED IN DUBLIN IN 1820 . A YOUNG-APPEARING 63, HE IS BY AGE, IF NOTBY POLITICAL STYLE, A MEMBER OF THE GENERATION THAT FREED IRELAND ANDHAS RULED IT EVER SINCE . AT SCHOOL, HE LEARNED HIS FOUR RS IN THEDUBLIN OF 50 YEARS AGO, REVOLUTION WAS PART OF THE CURRICULUM AND BYTHE AGE OF 14 HAD JOINED THE REPUBLICAN NA FIANNA EIREANN, A SORT OFBOY SCOUT UNDERGROUND . TWO YEARS LATER, WHEN THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMYOCCUPIED THE DUBLIN POST OFFICE AT THE START OF THE BOTCHED 1916 EASTERWEEK RISING, SEAN WAS THE YOUNGEST REBEL OF THEM ALL, SPENT FOUR DAYSON THE ROOF WITH A RIFLE, WAITING FOR THE BRITISH TO MOUNT ANOLD-FASHIONED INFANTRY CHARGE . HE SAYS WRYLY : " I'M AFRAID WE HADRATHER NAIVE IDEAS ABOUT MODERN WARFARE . " WHEN BRITISH SHELLS ENDEDTHE FIASCO, 15 IRISH LEADERS WERE SHOT . YOUNG LEMASS WAS TAKENPRISONER AND RELEASED WITHIN A MONTH, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF HIS AGE .ACCORDING TO CHERISHED, IF APOCRYPHAL DUBLIN LEGEND, " THE COPS GAVEA KICK IN THE ARSE AND TOLD HIM TO GO HOME TO HIS MOM . " POOR RISK .BUT IN THE TURBULENT YEARS WHEN THE IRISH REBELS FOUGHT AGAINSTBRITAIN'S BLACK AND TANS, SEAN LEMASS GREW INTO A RUGGED GUERRILLAFIGHTER IN THE I.R.A.'S DUBLIN BRIGADE . HE WAS JAILED BY THE ENGLISHFOUR TIMES, ESCAPED ONCE . AFTER THE 1921 TREATY, BY WHICH BRITAINCREATED THE SELF-GOVERNING IRISH FREE STATE BUT RETAINED JURISDICTIONOVER THE SIX PROTESTANT COUNTIES OF ULSTER, CIVIL WAR FLARED BETWEEN "PRO-TREATY " IRISHMEN AND DE VALERA'S FOLLOWERS, WHO CRIED THAT IRELANDCOULD NOT ACCEPT PARTITION . LEMASS, AN OFFICER ON DE VALERA'S STAFF,WAS CAPTURED BY THE OTHER SIDE AND IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR . IN JAIL HECONTINUED HIS WAR-SHATTERED EDUCATION WITH A CRAM COURSE IN ECONOMICS,POLITICS AND IRISH REVOLUTIONARY WRITINGS . THOUGH HE NEVER RETURNED TOPRISON AFTER HIS RELEASE IN 1923, FOUR-TIME LOSER LEMASS WAS PLAINLY APOOR MATRIMONIAL RISK . WHEN HE STARTED COURTING PRETTY, VIVACIOUSKATHLEEN HUGHES, HE HAD THE ADDED DISADVANTAGES OF HAVING TO PLACATEHER FATHER, A DUBLIN CARPENTER AND AN ANGLOPHILE . HE WARNED HISDAUGHTER : " THAT BOY IS ALWAYS ON THE RUN ; HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TOMAKE A HOME FOR YOU . " KATHLEEN DECIDED TO RISK IT ANYWAY . THEY WEREMARRIED IN 1924, HAVE A SON NOEL, WHO IS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, ANDTHREE DAUGHTERS (THE ELDEST, MAUREEN, IS MARRIED TO CHARLES HAUGHEY,THE SHREWD, HARD-KNUCKLED MINISTER OF JUSTICE, WHO IS TIPPED AS APOTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER) .LEMASS' BOLD PROGRAM OF INDUSTRIALIZATION HASALREADY CREATED NEW JOBS AND WEALTH IN AN ECONOMY WHOSE PRIMARYPRODUCT, BEEF FOR BRITAIN, HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAVEBEEN POTATOES TO GO WITH IT . AS NEW OPPORTUNITY AT HOME LOWERS THEPERILOUSLY HIGH EMIGRATION RATE, THE GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY BEGINNING TOREBUT THE BITTER QUIP THAT IRELAND IS " A HOME FOR MEN RATHER THAN ABREEDING GROUND FOR EMIGRANTS AND BULLOCKS . " THE COUNTRY'S RAPTUROUSHUZZAS FOR JOHN KENNEDY WERE MORE THAN AN EXPRESSION OF PRIDE IN A GAELMADE GOOD TO MANY YOUNG IRISHMEN, HE SEEMS MORE REAL THAN THE IRISHMARTYRS WHOSE STREAKED STATUES FILL DUBLIN'S PARKS WITH SILENTDECLAMATION . JACK'S HOMECOMING EPITOMIZED TO THE IRISH THE SUCCESSFULDISTANCE THEY THEMSELVES HAVE TRAVELED . SPANGLISH & SPELLS . HOWEVERFAR THEY MAY GO, THE IRISH RETAIN A DEEP SENSE OF THEIR PAST AND THEMYTHS AND MEMORIES THAT CROWD THEIR WILD, LONELY LAND . " THE GODSWHISTLE IN THE AIR, " WROTE SEAN O'FAOLAIN . " THE OTHERWORLD IS ALWAYSAT ONE'S SHOULDER . " THE OTHERWORLD AND THE REAL PAST ARE INSEPARABLYBOUND TOGETHER IN THE IRISH IMAGINATION AND IN THE RUNIC PLACE NAMES,FROM THE PAGAN LANDMARK CALLED TWO BREASTS OF DANA TO ANCIENTWATERFORD, WHERE IN 1170 STRONGBOW, THE NORMAN EARL OF PEMBROKE,CLAMPED 7F CENTURIES OF ENGLISH RULE ON IRELAND . WHAT THE MISTS OFLEGEND CANNOT OBSCURE IS THAT FOR AGES OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ANDECONOMIC EXPLOITATION, THROUGH COUNTLESS RISINGS AND REPRISALS, THEIRISH SLAVED, STARVED AND BATTLED FOR THEIR LAND AS STUBBORNLY AS IFIRELAND ITSELF WERE THE ISLE OF THE BLEST . THE REMOTE LITTLE ISLAND INTHE ATLANTIC HAS CAST ITS SHADOW ACROSS THE CIVILIZED WORLD SINCE THEDARK AGES, WHEN IRISH PRIESTS AND SCHOLARS ROAMED EUROPE EXPOUNDING NEW(AND MOSTLY HERETICAL) THEOLOGIES . IN A DIASPORA EVEN GREATER THAN THEEXPULSION OF THE JEWS, MORE THAN 3,000,000 IRISHMEN IN THE PAST 100YEARS HAVE SCATTERED ACROSS THE WORLD, FORMING WHAT AN IRISH WRITERCALLS " ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT SECRET SOCIETIES, WITH BRANCHESEVERYWHERE " THOUGH THE SOCIETY WAS NEVER VERY SECRET . EVERYONE HASHIS OWN LIST OF GREAT IRISHMEN, BUT THERE IS NO DENYING THAT THE GIFTSOF THE IRISH HAVE ALWAYS ENRICHED OTHER COUNTRIES MORE THAN THEIR OWN .THEIR TALENT FOR POLITICS, FOR FAITH, ABOVE ALL FOR WORDS, GAVE MOREBRILLIANT POLITICIANS, DISTINGUISHED CHURCHMEN AND MAGICAL WRITERS TOTHE U.S . AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THAN TO IRELAND . PERHAPS ONLYTHEIR TALENT FOR FIGHTING, WHILE AMPLY EXPORTED, AS AMPLY REMAINED ATHOME . THOUGH IN FOREIGN LANDS, THEY INVINCIBLY STAYED THEMSELVES ;THEY ALSO SHOWED AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO ADAPT TO OTHER CULTURES, WHETHERIN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE THEY CONCOCTED A LILTING LINGUA FRANCA KNOWN ASSPANGLISH, OR DOWN UNDER, WHERE THEY DEVELOPED A SPECTACULAR SPORTKNOWN AS AUSTRALIAN RULES, A BLEND OF GAELIC FOOTBALL AND RUGBY .THOUGH THERE WAS HARDLY A COUNTRY OR A FIELD OF ENDEAVOR WHERE IRISHMENFAILED TO MAKE A MARK OR A MINT, THE DIMINISHING NUMBER OF THEIRCOMPATRIOTS AT HOME KEPT WONDERING FRETFULLY IF THEY WERE A VANISHINGRACE .HEAT WITH PEAT . WHEN SINN FEIN BROKE APART, YOUNG LEMASSWAS THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF DE VALERA'S NEW FIANNA FAIL (HEROES OFDESTINY) PARTY, WHICH CAME TO POWER IN 1932 AND HAS BEEN IN OFFICEALMOST CONTINUALLY EVER SINCE . AT 32, LEMASS WAS THE YOUNGEST MEMBEROF DE VALERA'S CABINET AND EARNED THE AFFECTIONATE BIBLICAL SOBRIQUET "BENJAMIN " (AFTER JACOB'S YOUNGEST SON) . THOUGH DEV HAD TAUGHTMATHEMATICS AND IS FERVENTLY BELIEVED BY MANY FOND COMPATRIOTS TO BEONE OF THE 13 MEN ON EARTH WHO COMPREHEND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THETAOISEACH HAD NEITHER HEAD NOR HEART FOR ECONOMICS, AND LEFT BENJAMINTO RUN HIS MINISTRY AS HE SAW FIT . LEMASS FACED MONUMENTAL PROBLEMS,FOR DURING THE '30S THE GOVERNMENT WAS LOCKED IN A VINDICTIVE, FUTILEECONOMIC WAR WITH THE ENGLISH, THOUGH IT REMAINED ECONOMICALLYDEPENDENT ON BRITAIN . HE STROVE DESPERATELY TO MOBILIZE ENOUGH NEWINDUSTRY TO SUPPLY THE NATION'S BASIC NEEDS, THOUGH AT HIGH COST ; HEALSO FOUNDED THE STATE TRANSPORT NETWORK AND ORGANIZED A NATIONALMERCHANT MARINE IN TIME TO KEEP IRELAND FED DURING WORLD WAR II, INWHICH HE TOOK ON THE ADDITIONAL JOB OF MINISTER OF SUPPLY, AND BYBRILLIANT IMPROVISATION AVERTED CRIPPLING SHORTAGES . UNTIL RECENTLY,IT WAS AXIOMATIC THAT " NOBODY BUT A FOOL WOULD INVEST " IN IRELAND .LEMASS DID NOT HESITATE TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS WHEREVER PRIVATE CAPITALWAS NOT FORTHCOMING FOR KEY PROJECTS . HE TOOK OVER A ONE-HORSE POWERCOMPANY AND BUILT IT INTO A NATIONWIDE NETWORK THAT HAS ELECTRIFIED 76PER CENT OF ALL IRISH FARMS . THE COUNTRY HAD NO OIL AND LITTLE COAL,BUT LEMASS FOUND AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INDUSTRIAL FUEL IN ITS PEATBOGS, WHERE HUGE MACHINES NOW CUT TURF THAT A BUSY, STATE-OWNEDPROCESSING PLANT TURNS INTO INEXPENSIVE, SLOWBURNING BRIQUETTES . AFTERA LONG POLITICAL WRANGLE, HE GOT IRELAND'S STATE-OWNED AIRLINE OFF THEGROUND, AND HAS WATCHED HAPPILY AS AER LINGUS' SHAMROCK-PAINTED PLANESHAVE MADE IT ONE OF THE FEW GOVERNMENT AIRLINES TO TURN A CONSISTENTPROFIT ON THE ATLANTIC RUN . THE VERY WORD SOCIALISM TERRIFIES FIANNAFAIL SUPPORTERS, WHO ARE NOT ONLY OVERWHELMINGLY CATHOLIC BUT INCLUDEMANY SMALL LANDOWNERS . YET ONE-THIRD OF ALL INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES INIRELAND TODAY ARE BANKROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS GONE FARTHERTOWARD NATIONALIZATION THAN EVEN BRITAIN'S SOCIALISTS ADVOCATE . LEMASSSAYS HE SHARES THE ATTITUDE TOWARD SOCIALISM THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN THELATE POPE JOHN'S ENCYCLICAL, PACEM IN TERRIS : THAT NO POLITICALSYSTEM IS UNDESIRABLE IF IT BENEFITS THE PEOPLE . TRIM SAILS . IN 1957,AFTER THEIR CHILDREN HAD GROWN UP, SEAN AND KATHLEEN LEMASS MOVED FROMTHEIR BIG OLD HOUSE IN DUBLIN TO AN UNPRETENTIOUS SEVENROOM BUNGALOW INA PLEASANT SUBURB SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER ISPICKED UP BY A GOVERNMENT CAR AT 9 : 45 A.M . EACH DAY . HE SELDOMRETURNS UNTIL AFTER DINNER . SOME YEARS AGO, LEMASS CUT DOWN ON GOLFAND CARDS TO THE RELIEF OF OLD POKER CRONIES WHO USUALLY WOUND UPLOSERS WHEN LEMASS PLAYED TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO THE JOB . STURDY (5 FT. 10 IN.) AND CAREFULLY GROOMED, HE HOLDS AMONG HIS FEW FOIBLES ANAVERSION TO THE BYRONIC MANES AFFECTED BY MANY IRISHMEN, AND HE DOESNOT HESITATE TO BARK AT FRIENDS, UNDERLINGS OR HIS SON WHEN THEY NEEDHAIRCUTS .SOME POLITICIANS CRITICIZE LEMASS FORBEING TOO MUCH OF A PRAGMATIST . " HE'S A BIT OF A FLY-BOY, " SAIDLABOR PARTY LEADER JAMES LARKIN . " HE TRIMS HIS SAILS TO DIFFERENTWINDS . " THE GREATEST CHALLENGE THAT LEMASS HAS TO FACE AS APOLITICIAN IS TO REVITALIZE DRAB, UNIMAGINATIVE FIANNA FAIL, MANY OFWHOSE FRONT-BENCH HEROES OF DESTINY HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE DEV FIRSTCAME TO OFFICE . SEVEN OF THE 13 MEMBERS OF THE LEMASS CABINET ARE 60OR UNDER, WHICH IS A RELATIVELY GREEN AGE IN IRISH POLITICS BUT HARDLYGREEN ENOUGH . THOUGH HE HAS LITTLE OF THE PERSONAL MAGNETISM OF OLDSPELLBINDER DEV, THE QUIET MAN'S DRIVE TO GET IRELAND INTO THE WORLD'SMARKETS AND FORUMS HAS ATTRACTED SOME OF THE BRIGHT, RESTIVE YOUNGIRISHMEN WHO ARE SHOWING A REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN POLITICS . TOTALEFFORT . LEMASS' MOST BRUISING DISAPPOINTMENT IN OFFICE WAS CHARLES DEGAULLE'S REJECTION OF BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET LAST YEAR. DETERMINED TO TAKE IRELAND INTO EUROPE ALONGSIDE BRITAIN, LEMASS HADALREADY STARTED WHITTLING TARIFF BARRIERS TO GIVE IRELAND'S OLDER ANDMOST COSSETED INDUSTRIES A WHIFF OF THE COLD COMPETITIVE WIND OUTSIDE .TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR IRELAND'S ENTRY, WHICH HE NOW BELIEVES CANNOT COMEBEFORE 1970, LEMASS HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY COMMITTED HIS NATION, WHICH HAS9,000 MEN UNDER ARMS, TO SUPPORT OF NATO POLICIES . IN 1949, AT NATO'SFOUNDING,THE GOVERNMENT DECLINED MEMBERSHIP WITH THE LEGALISTICARGUMENT THAT TO JOIN AN ALLIANCE WITH BRITAIN WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TORECOGNITION OF ULSTER, WHOSE EXISTENCE THE REPUBLIC HAS NEVER ACCEPTED. TO LEMASS, BY CONTRAST, ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING MOTIVES FOR SEEINGBRITAIN AND IRELAND INSIDE THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IS THE VERY PROSPECTTHAT IRELAND WOULD THEREBY TAKE A STEP CLOSER TO REUNIFICATION .AUTOMATIC DISMANTLING OF THEIR MUTUAL TARIFF BARRIERS UNDER COMMONMARKET RULES, SAYS LEMASS, WOULD FINALLY NECESSITATE A DEGREE OFCOOPERATION BETWEEN PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC IRELAND . INSTEAD OF THEPRESENT PROLONGED FARCE OF NONRECOGNITION NEITHER COUNTRY WILL EVENPERMIT EXTRADITION OF CRIMINALS BY THE OTHER AND CONTINUED STAGNATIONOF ULSTER'S ECONOMY, LEMASS FORESEES " A TOTAL NATIONAL EFFORT IN WHICHOLD DIFFERENCES AND ANIMOSITIES CAN BE FORGOTTEN . " ALL THE DETAILS .THE GOVERNMENT'S EAGERNESS TO RAISE IRELAND'S " GREEN CURTAIN, " ASLEMASS CALLS IT, REFLECTS A GROWING COSMOPOLITANISM IN THE UNIVERSITIESAND POPULATION CENTERS . THE IRISH HAVE MADE EXECUTIVES AND TECHNICIANSFROM MORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES RESOUNDINGLY WELCOME . THEY CHEEREDMIGHTILY FOR SCHOOLGIRL HARUMI SUZUKI, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF AJAPANESE PLANT MANAGER AT SHANNON, WHEN SHE CARRIED OFF FIRST AND THIRDPRIZES FOR IRISH POETRY AND GAELIC RECITATION . YOUNG IRELAND'SHORIZONS ARE BEING BROADENED BY THE FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEENFLOCKING TO IRISH UNIVERSITIES, WHERE THEY COMPRISE NEARLY 17 PER CENTOF TOTAL ENROLLMENT ; MOST COME FROM AFRO-ASIAN COUNTRIES, WHERE THEDISTINCTIVE ACCENT OF EX-COLONIAL, NONALIGNED DUBLIN HAS BECOMESOMETHING OF A STATUS SYMBOL . THE VISITING STUDENTS, IN TURN, HAVEGENERATED NEW INTEREST IN LANGUAGE AND HISTORY COURSES AMONG THEIRIRISH FRIENDS . THE ULTRACONSERVATIVE ROMAN CATHOLIC CLERGY STILLHEAVILY CENSORS THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT . AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER,MANY OF THE BEST NATIVE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM LIBRARIES,INCLUDING WORKS BY GEORGE MOORE, LIAM O'FLAHERTY, O'CASEY, FRANKO'CONNOR, SHAW, BRENDAN BEHAN . BUT THINGS ARE EASING UP A LITTLE .CINEMATIC SEX HAS BECOME SO MUCH SEXIER AND MORE FREQUENT, EXPLAINSJUSTICE MINISTER HAUGHEY, THAT THE CENSORS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GO EASYWITH THE SCISSORS, " OR ELSE OUR CINEMAS WON'T GET ANY FILMS AT ALL . "ANOTHER SIGN OF THE NEW LIBERALITY IS A SCHEDULED VISIT BY THE BOLSHOIBALLET TO DUBLIN THIS MONTH, FOR IRISH MISTRUST OF THE INTRIGUOUSRUSSIANS IS SO KEEN THAT THEY HAVE YET TO RECOGNIZE THE 45-YEAR-OLDSOVIET GOVERNMENT .TELEVISION, WHICH NOW LIGHTS UP MORE THAN 200,000SCREENS, IS A PERENNIAL ASSAULT ON GAELIC PURITANISM . IRELAND'S OWNSTATION COMPETES WITH PROGRAMS BEAMED FROM BRITAIN THAT SEEM INCREDIBLYRISQUE TO IRISH VIEWERS ; THE BBC'S UNINHIBITED COVERAGE OF CHRISTINEKEELER'S EXPLOITS HAS EVEN JOGGED THE STODGY, SELF-CENSORING IRISHPRESS INTO GIVING READERS ALL THE DETAILS . MANY IRISHMEN, INCREASINGLYRESENTFUL OF CENSORSHIP, HAVE TAKEN TO SAMPLING CENSORED BOOKS, FILMSOR PLAYS BY TAKING THE 90-MINUTE FLIGHT TO LONDON WHERE FAR MOREHORRENDOUS TEMPTATIONS ABOUND . REBELS & MONARCHS . THE IRISH HAVEWRITTEN SOME OF THE TENDEREST LOVE LYRICS IN ENGLISH LITERATURE, BUT INTHEIR ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX, IRISHMEN SOMETIMES RESEMBLECOLOMBIA'S KOGI INDIANS, WHO, DESPISING WOMEN, SPEND ALL THEIR TIMEDISCUSSING PHILOSOPHY WITH OTHER MALES AND CHEWING COCOA LEAVES TO COOLOFF THE SEXUAL URGES . AN ACID AXIOM AMONG IRISH GIRLS RUNS : " PUT ANIRISH FELLER IN A ROOM WITH A GIRL AND TWO BOTTLES OF STOUT, AND HE'LLPICK THE STOUT ANY TIME . " MANY EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR HISSEEMING MISOGYNY : THE EPIC SUSPICION THAT WAR AND THE GODS ARE MOREIMPORTANT THAN MERE LOVE ; THE RELENTLESS EMOTIONAL DOMINANCE OF IRISHMOTHERS OVER IRISH SONS ; THE ODDLY PURITANICAL STREAK IN IRISHCATHOLICISM ; ABOVE ALL, THE HERITAGE OF HARDSHIP THAT GIVES THE IRISHA MORTAL TERROR OF INSECURITY AND ENCOURAGES THEM TO STAY CELIBATE . ATLEAST SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE CHANGING, AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THESEXES SEEM LESS SELF-CONSCIOUS AND AT TIMES DOWNRIGHT FRIENDLY . THEIRISH NOW WED YOUNGER ; THE AVERAGE MARRIAGE AGE DROPPED FROM NEARLY35 FOR MEN IN 1929 TO JUST OVER 30, FROM 29 FOR WOMEN TO JUST UNDER 27. FOR THE YOUNG, ONE OF THE MOST JOYOUS INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS HASBEEN A PROLIFERATION OF DANCE HALLS, WHICH HAVE REACHED SCORES OF SMALLCOMMUNITIES, AND A BURGEONING OF BANDS " 200 IN ALL THAT KEEP THE OULDSOD JUMPING WITH HIPPETYHOPPETY JAZZ AND CARRY SUCH INTRIGUING NAMES ASREBELS, JETS, MONARCHS . UNLIKE THE OLD DAYS, WHEN THE LOCAL PRIESTWOULD OFTEN DISPERSE A COUNTRY CEILIDH AT SUNDOWN, DANCE-HALL HOURS AREREGULATED BY MAGISTRATES, WHO TEND TO BE MORE LIBERAL . AND, AS ALWAYS,THE WESTERN WORLD HAS ITS PLAYBOYS . IN LONDON, WHERE ONE IN EIGHTBIRTHS IS ILLEGITIMATE, AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT A DISPROPORTIONATENUMBER OF UNWED PEGEENS COME OVER TO HAVE THEIR BABIES FREE ONBRITAIN'S NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE .THE MOST CONSPICUOUS VICE OF THE IRISH IN TIMESPAST HAS BEEN " THE DRINK . " TODAY, THOUGH THE PUBS KEEP LONGER HOURSAND MOST IRISHMEN CAN AFFORD TO DRINK MORE, PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS IS NOLONGER THE COMMON SPECTACLE IT USED TO BE, AND BAREFOOT BOYS NO LONGERTROT THROUGH CITY STREETS BEARING JUGS OF FOAMING SOUT OR BOTTLES OFBRANDY HOME TO DAD . THE YOUNGER GENERATION SEEMS TO BE MORE SOBER THANITS PARENTS . ALSO, ALCOHOLIC HABITS ARE CHANGING : MORE DRINKING ISDONE AT HOME NOWADAYS ; COCKTAILS AND HARD LIQUOR ARE CUTTING INTOBEER CONSUMPTION ; AND MANY PUBS, WHICH HAD LONG BEEN JEALOUSLYGUARDED MALE PRESERVES, HAVE OPENED " SINGING LOUNGES " WHERE ANIRISHMAN CAN TAKE HIS WIFE OR GIRL . THE IMAGE OF THE BOOZY,BELLIGERENT IRISHMAN CONDEMNED AS SHEER HOSTILE PROPAGANDA BY SEANLEMASS DIES HARD, NONETHELESS . INDEED, DRUNK OR SOBER, FEW PEOPLE ONEARTH CAN RAISE A GLASS WITH GREATER GUSTO OR STYLE . RADIANT GOALS .IRELAND FACES MANY MORE URGENT PROBLEMS . THE COUNTRY IS STILLCRITICALLY SHORT OF MODERN HOUSING ; HUNDREDS OF ONCE ELEGANT GEORGIANMANSIONS IN DUBLIN HAVE FOR YEARS HELD SOME OF EUROPE'S MOST SQUALIDSLUMS . WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN EASING IRELAND'SHISTORICALLY HARSH SYSTEM OF FARM LEASING, NEARLY 1,000,000 OF THECOUNTRY'S 11 MILLION ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND ARE STILL COVERED BYELEVEN-MONTH LEASES, WHICH DISCOURAGE TENANTS AND OWNERS ALIKE FROMIMPROVING THE LAND (AFTER TWELVE MONTHS ON A FARM, AN IRISH TENANT HASA LEGAL CLAIM TO BUY IT) . THOUGH 45 ACRES OF GOOD LAND ARE THEACCEPTED MINIMUM FOR A VIABLE FARM, THERE ARE STILL 208,000 FARMS (OF360,000) WITH LESS THAN 30 ACRES EACH . IN THE POOR WESTERN COUNTIES,ONE IN THREE FARMS IS STILL LESS THAN 15 ACRES, AND SONS GROW OLDWAITING FOR FATHERS TO DIE . THOUGH SEAN LEMASS IS OFTEN CHIDED INPARLIAMENT FOR FOOT-DRAGGING ON HOUSING AND FARM REFORM, MOST OF THENATION'S PROBLEMS ARE A LONGTIME LEGACY OF NATIONAL POVERTY ANDPOLITICAL TIMIDITY . WHAT IS RADIANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT IRELAND TODAY ISTHE SERIOUS EXPECTATION THAT ITS ILLS AND LAGS WILL IN FACT BECORRECTED . LEMASS WILL SOON RELEASE DETAILS OF A NEW SIX-YEAR ECONOMICPROGRAM THAT AIMS TO BOOST THE G.N.P . 50 PER CENT BY 1970 . IF ITSUCCEEDS AND HIS GOALS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN SET FAR SHORT OF ACTUALPERFORMANCE THE NATION WILL HAVE TRAVELED A LONG WAY FROM " THEUNFORTUNATE COUNTRY " OF IRELAND'S ANCIENT LAMENT . THE VARIED ANDLIVELY VIRTUES OF THE IRISH, WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE OFTEN SHADED INTOWEAKNESSES WHEN THEY WERE NOT VIGOROUSLY APPLIED TO A CAUSE, ARE THENATION'S BEST ASSURANCE THAT IT CAN FIND THE FUTURE IT SEEKS FOR ITSELF. HOWEVER BRIGHT THE GOAL, IRELAND WILL STILL BE MANY LIGHTYEARS AWAYFROM THE BLEST ISLE . BUT WHO KNOWS ? THEY MAY HAVE THEIR TROUBLESTHERE TOO .
