COMMUNISTS THE PLACE IS BERLIN, THE PROBLEM ISPEKING ANTICIPATING PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TUMULTUOUS WEST BERLINRECEPTION, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HASTILY ARRANGED A TRIP OF HIS OWN . HEDECIDED TO GO TO EAST BERLIN, OSTENSIBLY TO CELEBRATE THE 70TH BIRTHDAYOF EAST GERMANY'S SPADEBEARDED COMMUNIST BOSS WALTER ULBRICHT . JUST 48HOURS AFTER KENNEDY, ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE WALL, HAD CRIED, " I AM ABERLINER, " KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED ON THE EAST SIDE, BENT ON SHOWING THATHE WAS A BERLINER TOO . BUT THE THIN WELCOMING CROWD WAS NOT EXACTLYEAGER TO MAKE HIM AN HONORARY CITIZEN . MINUTES BEFORE KHRUSHCHEV'STURBOPROP LANDED AT SCHONEFELD AIRPORT, AN ANNOUNCER DRILLED THESPECTATORS IN A PROPER GREETING : " NOW, WHEN OUR FRIEND STEPS OUT OFHIS PLANE, WE WILL ALL CHEER IN UNISON, HIP, HIP, HURRAH . " WHENNIKITA STEPPED OUT OF HIS PLANE, ALL SMILES, THE CROWD WAS SILENT ANDONLY THE HONOR GUARD OF SOLDIERS SHOUTED, OFFICIALLY . IN CONTRAST TOPRESIDENT KENNEDY'S WELCOME BY MORE THAN A MILLION WEST BERLINERS, ASCANT 250,000 EAST BERLIN FACTORY WORKERS, SECRETARIES ANDSCHOOLCHILDREN, MARCHING IN CLOSED FORMATIONS, TURNED OUT FORKHRUSHCHEV . ALONG PARTS OF THE 16-MILE ROUTE TO THE RED CITY HALL, THEONLY SPECTATORS WERE THE VOLKSPOLIZEI . THE REAL REASON FORKHRUSHCHEV'S PRESENCE IN EAST BERLIN, OF COURSE, WAS NOT THAT HE WANTEDTO HELP ULBRICHT BLOW OUT THE CANDLES, NOR WAS IT ENTIRELY A MATTER OFTRYING TO COUNTERACT THE EMOTIONS STIRRED UP BY THE KENNEDY VISIT .MOST OF ALL, KHRUSHCHEV WANTED TO MEET WITH HIS EAST EUROPEAN SATELLITECHIEFS TO CLOSE RANKS BEFORE THE CHINESE ARRIVE IN MOSCOW THIS WEEK TOCONFER ON THE WORSENING SINO-SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT . DISTRIBUTIONPROBLEM . THEIR DISPUTE GREW SO ANGRY LAST WEEK THAT MOSCOW RESORTED TOEXPELLING CHINESE DIPLOMATS, A TREATMENT HITHERTO RESERVED FOR WESTERNREPRESENTATIVES . BEHIND THIS LATEST EXPLOSION WAS A 24,000-WORD PEKINGBLAST AT KHRUSHCHEV'S POLICIES, DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT HIS PEACEFULCOEXISTENCE LINE IS A COWARDLY BETRAYAL OF TRUE RED REVOLUTIONARIES,THAT HE IS SHILLY-SHALLYING WITH THE " PAPER TIGERS " OF IMPERIALISM,AND THAT HE IS " SUBVERTING " OTHER COMMUNIST PARTIES . WHEN THERUSSIANS REFUSED TO PUBLISH THE PEKING LETTER, ISSUED TWO WEEKS AGO,THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN MOSCOW STARTED CIRCULATING COPIES, THEREBYPROVOKING THE KREMLIN TO THROW OUT THREE EMBASSY ATTACHES AND TWO OTHERCHINESE . PEKING CALLED THE ACTION " UNREASONABLE AND UNTENABLE, "NOTED THAT IT WAS " UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE RELATIONSBETWEEN OUR TWO SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, " AND ACCUSED MOSCOW OFDELIBERATELY TRYING TO CREATE OBSTACLES TO THE SCHEDULED TALKS . EVENAS KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED IN EAST BERLIN, THE CHINESE EMBASSY THERE WENTRIGHT AHEAD DISTRIBUTING COPIES OF THE PEKING MANIFESTO TO INTERESTEDBYSTANDERS .STALIN'S GHOST . ONHAND FOR TALKS WITH KHRUSHCHEV IN EAST BERLIN WERE THE SATELLITE CHIEFSOF POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUNGARY AND BULGARIA . ABSENT, AT LEAST FROMAMONG EARLY ARRIVALS : RUMANIAN RED BOSS GHEORGHE GHEORGHIUDEJ, WHO ISNOT ONLY FEUDING WITH MOSCOW OVER ECONOMIC PLANNING BUT IS WARM TOWARDPEKING, ALLOWED ITS MANIFESTO TO APPEAR IN THE RUMANIAN PRESS . WHATCONFRONTED THE SMALL-SCALE RED SUMMIT MEETING WAS THE PICTURE OF THESINO-SOVIET RIFT TEARING INTO THE COMMUNIST FABRIC ALL OVER THE WORLD .IN MOSCOW, A MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONVOCATION OF FEMALE COMRADES FOUNDTHE RUSSIA-CHINA ISSUE A CAUSE FOR NEARHYSTERIA (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) .SUCH RED FRONT ORGANIZATIONS AS THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONSAND THE WORLD PEACE COUNCIL HAVE ALSO STARTED SQUABBLING OVER THE ISSUE. IN ASIA, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA, MANY COMMUNIST PARTIES ARE FEELINGTHE SPLIT ; WHERE COMMUNISM HAS PROSPERED BY APPEARING " MODERATE, "PARTY LEADERS BLUNTLY DENOUNCE RED CHINA AND ARE BEGINNING TO PURGEPEKING PARTISANS . EVEN IN WESTERN EUROPE'S OVERWHELMINGLY PRO-MOSCOWPARTIES, SOME YOUNG REDS HAVE RESPONDED TO PEKING'S REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL,HAVE JOINED RED CHINESE " FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES . " KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELFBUSILY COUNTERATTACKED AGAINST THE CHINESE . BEFORE HIS BERLIN TRIP, ATA CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING IN MOSCOW WHOSE CHIEF TASK WAS TO COPE WITHTHE RESTLESSNESS OF RUSSIA'S OWN INTELLECTUALS, KHRUSHCHEV DEALT WITHTHE MORE URGENT PEKING PROBLEM . TYPICALLY, HE INTERPRETED PRESIDENTKENNEDY'S " STRATEGY OF PEACE " SPEECH AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LASTMONTH AS A SIGN OF WESTERN WEAKNESS, USED IT AS EVIDENCE THAT HISPOLICY OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE IS PAYING OFF . THE RED CHINESE, SAIDKHRUSHCHEV, ARE REALLY PESSIMISTS IN PURSUING A NOW-OR-NEVERREVOLUTIONARY DOGMA, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A DESPERATE HURRYTO START WARS AND REVOLUTIONS IF THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THELONG-RANGE, INEVITABLE VICTORY OF COMMUNISM . MOREOVER, THEY USE " THENATIONAL, RACIAL APPROACH " IN WIDENING THE SCHISM BETWEEN COMMUNISTS .KHRUSHCHEV ALSO HEATEDLY DEFENDED HIS DESTALINIZATION DRIVE, ATTACKEDMAO TSE-TUNG (WITHOUT NAMING HIM) FOR BUILDING HIS OWN CULT OFPERSONALITY . SAID KHRUSHCHEV, RAISING HIS FAVORITE GHOST : " WE AREAGAINST LEADERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD, AND THATTHE PEOPLE ARE A MASS THAT MUST LISTEN ONLY TO THEM AND APPLAUD . THATWAS TYPICAL OF STALIN . " AMID THESE EXCHANGES, THE ATMOSPHERE COULDSCARCELY BE MORE UNPLEASANT FOR THE SCHEDULED SINO-SOVIET ENCOUNTERTHIS WEEK IF INDEED BOTH PARTIES ARE NOT TOO ANGRY TO GO THROUGH WITHIT . THE SPLIT, WESTERN OBSERVERS WERE CAREFUL TO POINT OUT, WAS STILLNOT " FINAL AND FORMAL . " BUT AS AN INFORMAL QUARREL, IT SEEMED TO BEAT LEAST IN THE QUARTER-FINALS .
