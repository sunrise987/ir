GREAT BRITAIN WEEKEND IN WASHINGTON FROM THE SOLICITOUS RECEPTIONHE GOT FROM THE NEW FRONTIER, THE LITTLE COLDEYED MAN WHO STEPPED OFFTHE AIRLINER IN WASHINGTON MIGHT HAVE BEEN BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTERRATHER THAN THE OPPOSITION LEADER . EVEN IN HIS OWN LABOR PARTY SIXMONTHS AGO, PIPE-PUFFING HAROLD WILSON WAS REGARDED AS A SLIPPERYOPPORTUNIST AND A CONSTANT THREAT TO THE PARTY'S HARDWON UNITY UNDERTHE LATE HUGH GAITSKELL . THOUGH HIS VIEWS ON MOST MAJOR ISSUES WERECALCULATEDLY MURKY, " LITTLE HAROLD, " AS HIS FOES CALL HIM, DREWLEFT-WING SUPPORT BY CONDEMNING U.S . HANDLING OF CUBA, CHEERING ON THEUNILATERALISTS, BITTERLY OPPOSING BRITAIN'S BID FOR COMMON MARKETMEMBERSHIP . HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT WILSON'S PAST THAT BROUGHT OUTWASHINGTON'S RED CARPET BUT HIS POTENTIAL FUTURE . EVEN THOUGHELECTIONS WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CALLED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR, NO U.S .POLICYMAKER COULD IGNORE TODAY'S GALLUP POLLS, WHICH GIVE THE LABORPARTY A RECORD 50 PER CENT TO 33F PER CENT LEAD OVER THE TORIES . IFTHAT TREND SHOULD CONTINUE, HAROLD WILSON WOULD BE BRITAIN'S NEXT PRIMEMINISTER . WHAT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS GOT LAST WEEK WAS AMPLEDEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT SINCE GAITSKELL'S DEATH, THE FLINTY,QUICK-WITTEDYORKSHIREMAN HAS HAD TOMOVE CLOSER TO THE POLITICAL CENTER TO HOLD THE PARTY TOGETHER AND TAKEHARD AND FAST STANDS ON WHICH BRITAIN'S ELECTORATE CAN WEIGH THE MERITSOF A LABOR GOVERNMENT . WILSON WAS PLAINLY ANXIOUS TO WIN THE NEWFRONTIER'S CONFIDENCE . AFTER AN INTENSIVE, FOUR-DAY ROUND OFCONFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND KEY ADMINISTRATIVE HANDS, THELABOR LEADER'S VIEWS ON MOST OUTSTANDING WORLD ISSUES SEEMED NOW ATLEAST AS CLOSE TO U.S . POLICY AS HAROLD MACMILLAN'S . " DENEGOTIATION. " WILSON'S MOST REASSURING MESSAGE WAS THAT HE UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTSNATO AS " THE CENTER OF OUR DEFENSE POLICY IN EUROPE . " TO THE DELIGHTOF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, WHICH HAS LONG TRIED IN VAIN TO PERSUADEBRITAIN TO BUILD UP ITS CHRONICALLY INADEQUATE GROUND FORCES ON THECONTINENT, WILSON ARGUED THAT BRITAIN COULD WELL AFFORD A STRONG ARMYIF, AS HE PROPOSES, IT WERE TO ELIMINATE ITS NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE " THESOCALLED INDEPENDENT, SO-CALLED BRITISH, SOCALLED DETERRENT . " THUS,IF ELECTED, WILSON WOULD " DENEGOTIATE " BRITAIN'S AGREEMENT AT NASSAUTO BUILD A POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, AND HOPE THEREBY TO DISCOURAGEOTHER NATIONS FROM BUILDING INDEPENDENT DETERRENTS . HE IS STRONGLYOPPOSED TO GIVING GERMANY A FINGER ON THE TRIGGER, WHICH " WOULD BEHIGHLY PROVOCATIVE TO THE SOVIET UNION AND MAKE IT EVEN HARDER TO GETAGREEMENTS, " PARTICULARLY ON THE MATTER OF DISARMAMENT . BELYINGREPORTS THAT HE WAS " SOFT " ON WEST BERLIN, WILSON INSISTED THAT ITMUST REMAIN A FREE AND VIABLE CITY, AND THAT ALLIED TROOPS WOULD HAVETO BE STATIONED THERE " FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . " RESERVATIONS .THERE WERE SOME ISSUES ON WHICH WILSON'S VIEWS WERE DIRECTLY AT ODDSWITH THOSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION ; U.S . OFFICIALS WERE INCLINED TOSHRUG THEM OFF AS LIP SERVICE TO LABOR'S LEFT WING . MOST IMPORTANTDIVERGENCE IS HIS SUPPORT FOR WITHDRAWAL OF NATO AND SOVIET TROOPS FROMCENTRAL EUROPE, MAKING " NUCLEAR-FREE " ZONES OF EAST AND WEST GERMANYAND HUNGARY A PROPOSAL THAT THE U.S . CONSIDERS IMPRACTICAL ANDDANGEROUS . WILSON SEEMED AS WOBBLY AS EVER ON SOME QUESTIONS, NOTABLYTHE COMMON MARKET, WHICH HE NOW CONDITIONALLY FAVORS . HE SUPPORTSGREATER EAST-WEST TRADE, WHICH IS NOT AN ADMINISTRATION GOAL, ANDFAVORS SEATING COMMUNIST CHINA IN THE U.N., WHICH IS DIRECTLY CONTRARYTO U.S . POLICY, BUT HE TOLD U.S . OFFICIALS THAT THESE ARE NOTHIGH-PRIORITY AIMS . THESE VIEWS GAVE REASON FOR CONTINUED RESERVATIONSABOUT HAROLD WILSON . MOREOVER, THOUGH HIS INCISIVE, PRAGMATIC STYLEUNDENIABLY IMPRESSED WASHINGTON, OLDER HEADS HAVE STILL TO BE PERSUADEDTHAT WILSON'S CONVICTIONS WILL NOT SHIFT AGAIN AS THEY HAVE SO MANYTIMES BEFORE .
