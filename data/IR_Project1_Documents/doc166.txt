THE $5,000,000 BINGO PARLOR IF PROSTITUTION IS THE WORLD'S OLDESTPROFESSION AND GAMBLING THE MOST PROFITABLE, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT WHEN YOUCOMBINE THE TWO ? A GOLD MINE OR SO SOUTH KOREA'S RULING JUNTATHOUGHT WHEN IT DREAMED UP WALKER HILL, A SPRAWLING, 156-ACRE COMPLEXOF GAMING TABLES AND HOT-PILLOW HOTELS DESIGNED TO ENTICE THE TOURISTTRADE AND, NOT INCIDENTALLY, THE 40,000 U.S . TROOPS STATIONED IN KOREA. OUT TO MANILA AND MACAO WENT THE CALL FOR CROUPIERS, AND FOURAMERICANS FROM LAS VEGAS MOVED IN TO MANAGE THE ACTION . BUT WHEN ITOPENED UP TEN MILES OUTSIDE SEOUL LAST WEEK, THE MONTE CARLO OF THEORIENT PROVED TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN A $5,000,000 BINGO PARLOR WITHSODA FOUNTAINS . THE TROUBLES FOR WALKER HILL (NAMED AFTER THE LATE U.S. GENERAL WALTON WALKER, WHO COMMANDED U.N . FORCES DURING THE KOREANWAR) BEGAN WHEN ITS ARCHITECTS, WHO HAD NEVER DESIGNED A HOTEL,POSITIONED BUNGALOWS SO ARTISTICALLY AND PRECARIOUSLY ON THE HILLSIDESTHAT A GOOD RAINFALL THREATENED TO SLIDE THEM MAJESTICALLY INTO THE HANRIVER ; THE MANAGEMENT IS NOW FRANTICALLY PLANTING TREES TO STOP MUDSLIDES . THEN PUBLIC FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR THE PROJECT MYSTERIOUSLYSTARTED TURNING UP IN PRIVATE POCKETS ; EIGHT TOP WALKER HILLOFFICIALS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST OR INVESTIGATION FOR EMBEZZLEMENTAND BRIBERY . SO BAD WAS WALKER HILL'S CREDIT RATING THAT LOUIS ( "SATCHMO " ) ARMSTRONG, WHOSE BAND GOT $60,000 FOR PLAYING THE OPENINGTWO-WEEK STAND, " DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF MAKING PLANE RESERVATIONS TOCOME HERE UNTIL OUR FEE CLEARED THE BANK BACK HOME . " THE WORST BLOW,HOWEVER, CAME WHEN G.I.S' MOTHERS BACK IN THE U.S . HEARD ABOUT THEAFFAIR . FEAR THAT THE U.S . ARMY WOULD DECLARE THE PLACE OFF LIMITSFORCED PROJECT OFFICIALS TO BAN GAMBLING, EXCEPT FOR BINGO AND SLOTMACHINES . AS FOR GIRLS, POTENTIAL HUSTLERS WERE TOLD TO PEDDLE THEIRWARES ELSEWHERE, THOUGH ONE WALKER HILL OFFICIAL ADMITTED THAT, " WHILEWE DO NOT ALLOW PROSTITUTION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO INSIST ON COUPLESPRODUCING A MARRIAGE LICENSE . " THERE WAS A MAD RUSH TO GET THE PLACEREADY FOR LAST WEEK'S GALA OPENING, AND GUESTS WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISEDTO FIND THAT THE SHOWERS WORKED, SHEETS WERE ON THE BEDS, AND THE ROASTBEEF IN THE DINING ROOM WAS NOT BAD AT ALL . BUT WITHOUT ITS TWO MAJORATTRACTIONS, WALKER HILL, IN ALL ITS MOTEL MODRUN SPLENDOR, WAS STILLHALF EMPTY . BECAUSE OF THE JUNTA'S SLOGAN, " AUSTERITY FOR PROGRESS, "SOUTH KOREANS WERE NOT ALLOWED INSIDE UNLESS THEY CAME AS GUESTS OFFOREIGNERS . THIS POLICY MIGHT HAVE TO BE CHANGED . AS ONE OBSERVER PUTIT : " IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MAKE A GO OF THIS PLACE, THEY'LLHAVE TO LET THE SOUTH KOREANS IN AND PROBABLY THE NORTH KOREANS TOO . "
