COLD WAR THE NONSIGNERS IN WASHINGTON THE AMBASSADORS WERE USHEREDINTO A FLOODLIT ANTEROOM AND WELCOMED BY VIRGINIA DUKE, A CHIC STATEDEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE WITH GREYING HAIR, WHO BEARS THE TITLE OF TREATYDEPOSITORY OFFICER . IN MOSCOW A VARIETY OF FOREIGN OFFICE TYPESUSHERED THE DIPLOMATS INTO A DAZZLING GOLD-AND-WHITE MARBLE ROOM IN THESPIRIDONOVKA PALACE . IN BOTH CITIES, AND IN LONDON AS WELL, THEEMISSARIES OF NATION AFTER NATION LINED UP TO SIGN THE NUCLEAR TEST BANTREATY . EVENTUALLY, BY STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE, THERE WILL BE MORETHAN 100 SIGNATORIES . KHRUSHCHEV CALLED IT " A REFERENDUM ON ALLCONTINENTS . " INEVITABLY, THE WORLD'S ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THENONSIGNERS . CHIEF AMONG THEM IS, OF COURSE, RED CHINA . HEIGHTENINGTHEIR BITTER IDEOLOGICAL QUARREL WITH MOSCOW, THE CHINESE CHARGED THATFOUR YEARS AGO NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAD WELSHED ON A PROMISE TO HELP THEMMAKE ATOMIC BOMBS BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PRESENT " A GIFT " TO PRESIDENTEISENHOWER ON THE EVE OF THE CAMP DAVID TALKS . IN A BITTER RADIOATTACK, THE CHINESE SAID THAT THE " REAL AIM OF THE SOVIET LEADERS " INNEGOTIATING THE TEST BAN " IS TO COMPROMISE WITH THE U.S . IN ORDER TOMAINTAIN A MONOPOLY OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND LORD IT OVER THE SOCIALISTCAMP . " PEKING ADDED THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD COMMITTED AN ACT OF "BETRAYAL " RESULTING IN " OPEN CAPITULATION BY THE SOVIET LEADERS TOU.S . IMPERIALISM . " THE SLOW ONES . CHINA'S ANTITREATY STAND WASBACKED BY AVOWEDLY PRO-PEKING ALBANIA, NORTH KOREA AND NORTH VIET NAM .SO FAR, THESE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THATTHEY WILL NOT SIGN . BUT CHARY OF ANGERING THE CHINESE, OTHER ASIANNATIONS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO INDICATE THEIR APPROVAL OF THE PACT . THEYINCLUDE NEPAL, WHICH LIES IN AN EXPOSED POSITION IN CHINA'S BORDERCONFLICT WITH INDIA ; CEYLON AND CAMBODIA, BOTH LEFTWING " NEUTRALS "; AND INDONESIA, WHICH IS HOPEFUL OF CHINESE SUPPORT IN ANY FUTUREACTION AGAINST THE SOON-TO-BE-BORN MALAYSIAN FEDERATION . TO MOSCOW'SCONSTERNATION, THE ONLY COMMUNIST NATION THAT HAS NOT YET SPOKEN OUTONE WAY OR THE OTHER IN THE WORLDWIDE " REFERENDUM " IS CUBA . DESPITETHE $1,000,000 A DAY THAT RUSSIA IS POURING INTO HIS ISLAND COMMUNE,FIDEL CASTRO IS STILL ANGRY OVER KHRUSHCHEV'S WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIETROCKETS LAST FALL . TRYING TO MAKE THE SOVIET LEADER SWEAT, CASTRO ISOBVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO BOOST HIS PRICE FOR SUPPORTING RUSSIA IN ITSSTRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE . BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT CUBA WILLULTIMATELY SIGN THE TREATY, FOR CASTRO NEEDS RUSSIA TO BUY HIS3,800,000-TON SUGAR CROP AND TO CONTINUE STEADY TRANSFUSION OF ECONOMICAID . THE LONELY ONES . THE SOLE NONSIGNER IN THE WESTERN CAMP ISFRANCE . EVEN FRANCO SPAIN, THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY WHICH DOES NOTHAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW, HAS SIGNED THE TREATY, LEAVINGFRANCE ISOLATED FROM ALL ITS CONTINENTAL NEIGHBORS . MOST GALLING TOCHARLES DE GAULLE WAS WEST GERMANY'S DECISION TO SIGN THE PACT AFTER AREASSURING PITCH IN BONN BY U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK . BONN'SACTION WAS DOUBLY UPSETTING TO FRANCE, FOR IT FOLLOWED AN ANNOUNCEMENTTHAT GERMANY AND THE U.S . WILL COOPERATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEWBATTLE TANK (TIME, AUG . 16) ; JUST THREE MONTHS AGO, PARIS WAS UNABLETO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GERMANS ON A SIMILAR PROJECT . BOTH BONNDECISIONS RAISED THE QUESTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THE FRANCO-GERMANFRIENDSHIP TREATY IS WORTH, AND BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN THE FACT THATWEST GERMANY STILL LOOKS TO THE U.S . AND NOT TO FRANCE FOR LEADERSHIP. STUBBORNLY FRANCE PREPARED FOR ANOTHER ATOMIC TEST IN THE SAHARA, BUTDE GAULLE'S ASPIRATIONS TO FRENCH LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE WERE ACIDLYDEMOLISHED BY PARIS' LE FIGARO . " IF KHRUSHCHEV REALLY BECOMESDISTURBED BY THE CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM BY CHINA, " SAID THEPAPER, " AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A CERTAINTY OF PEACE ON HIS WESTERNFRONT, THEN HE WILL NOT COME TO SEEK AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE, WHICH ISNEGLIGIBLE IN HIS EYES, EVEN WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS, BUT WITH THE U.S.,WHOSE INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR . THIS WASPROVED AT THE RECENT CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW, WHERE WE SHONE BY OURABSENCE .
