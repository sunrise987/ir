CAMBODIA     THE SLUMBERING PRINCE     FORMER U.S . SECRETARY OF STATEDEAN ACHESON IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED AMERICANS INPNOM PENH . THE REASON DATES BACK TO LAST YEAR, WHEN ACHESONSUCCESSFULLYREPRESENTED CAMBODIA BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THEHAGUE IN A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE WITH THAILAND . LAST WEEK THE U.S .TRIED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS FRIENDSHIP IN AN EFFORT TO END ITS ACERBICAND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS LITTLE QUARREL WITH CAMBODIA'S VAIN,UNPREDICTABLE LEADER, PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK . THE U.S . WAS RUDELYREBUFFED . SENDING ACHESON OUT TO CAMBODIA ON A PEACEMAKING MISSIONWOULD BE FINE, DECLARED THE PRINCE, BUT ONLY ON THREE CONDITIONS : 1)THAT WASHINGTON APOLOGIZE FOR THE U.S . DIPLOMAT WHO DESCRIBED AS "BARBAROUS " RADIO CAMBODIA'S TASTELESS COMMENTS ON JOHN F . KENNEDY'SASSASSINATION, 2) A FORMAL WITHDRAWAL BY U.S . DIPLOMATS OF A QUESTIONASKING WHETHER THE " CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT HAD REJOICED OVER KENNEDY'SDEATH, " 3) AND THE CLOSING DOWN OF A RADIO STATION THAT SIHANOUKCLAIMED WAS RUN BY CIA IN LAOS OR THAILAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDINGSUBVERSIVE BROADCASTS INTO CAMBODIA . WASHINGTON TERMED SIHANOUK'SCONDITIONS " TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE . " IN FACT, SIHANOUK IS PROBABLYONLY TAUNTING THE U.S . OUT OF FEAR OF THE RED CHINESE AND WANTS TOAVOID AN OVERT DIPLOMATIC BREAK . SIHANOUK IS STILL ANXIOUS FOR AGENEVA CONFERENCE TO GUARANTEE CAMBODIAN NEUTRALITY, BUT SUCH ACONFERENCE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT U.S . PARTICIPATION . AS SIHANOUKHIMSELF SAID LAST WEEK AFTER CLOSING CAMBODIA'S EMBASSY IN LONDON, " ITAPPEARS NECESSARY, WITHOUT A DIPLOMATIC BREAK, TO PUT OUR RELATIONS INSLUMBER . /
