MIDDLE EAST SPREADING INFECTION IN THEMIDDLE EAST, REVOLUTION IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS . A REVOLT INYEMEN LAST SEPTEMBER OUSTED THE CENTURIES-OLD DYNASTY OF THE IMAM ANDINSTALLED A " REPUBLIC " THAT HAS EVER SINCE BEEN PROPPED UP BY 20,000EGYPTIAN TROOPS SENT IN BY GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . IN TWO BLOODY DAYS'WORK LAST MONTH, IRAQI ARMY OFFICERS DEPOSED AND KILLED PSYCHOTICDICTATOR ABDUL KARIM KASSEM . LAST WEEK, ON A QUIET, GREY FRIDAYMORNING, THE INFECTION REACHED SYRIA . BROKEN BONDS . EVERYONE KNEW ITWAS COMING, FROM SYRIA'S STRONGMAN, GENERAL ABDEL KARIM ZAHREDDIN, DOWNTO THE LOWLIEST PRIVATE IN THE ARMY . WHEN ZAHREDDIN SEVERED SYRIA'SUNION WITH EGYPT 17 MONTHS AGO, HE HAD PROFITED FROM THE NATION'SREVULSION AGAINST THE POLICE STATE AND HARSH ECONOMIC CONTROLS IMPOSEDBY NASSER . BUT SYRIANS, PASSIONATE BELIEVERS IN ARAB UNITY, ALSO FELTGUILTY ABOUT BREAKING THE BONDS . WISPY PRESIDENT NAZEM EL-KOUDSISIGHED, " THE TROUBLE WITH SYRIANS IS THAT WE ARE NEVER CONCERNED WITHJUST OUR OWN PROBLEMS BUT WITH ISSUES AFFECTING ALL ARABS . " THEREGIME SURVIVED THREE MAJOR AND COUNTLESS MINOR CONSPIRACIES, BUT ONCEIRAQ REBELLED AGAINST DICTATOR KASSEM IN THE NAME OF ARAB UNITY, THESYRIAN REGIME WAS DOOMED . SIX CABINET MINISTERS RESIGNED DISCREETLY,AND WHEN MEMBERS OF THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY WERE ASKED TO REPLACETHEM, THEY REFUSED . DESPERATE PRESIDENT KOUDSI EAGERLY OFFERED TOUNITE SYRIA WITH THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ BUT RECEIVEDNO OFFICIAL REPLY FROM BAGHDAD . SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED TO PREVENT STUDENTDEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND TANKS AND ARMORED CARSPATROLLED THE STREETS OF DAMASCUS . THE REVOLUTION CAME AS QUIETLY AS ASUNRISE . GENERAL ZAHREDDIN SUSPECTED COLONEL MOHAMMED HARIRI, CHIEF OFTHE SOUTHERN FRONT COMMAND, OF BEING A TOP CONSPIRATOR AND ORDERED HIMSENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY AS MILITARY ATTACHE TO JORDAN . HARIRI REFUSEDTO GO, AND THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN COMMAND BACKED HIM UP . AN ARMOREDCOLUMN MOVED OUT FROM THE BADANI MILITARY CAMP AND ENTERED DAMASCUS,WHERE THE TANKS PATROLLING THE STREETS QUICKLY JOINED THE REBELS .SCARCELY A SHOT WAS FIRED AS SYRIA CHANGED ITS ALLEGIANCE . TEMPERSWERE SO COOL THAT PRESIDENT KOUDSI WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN AT HOME WITHHIS FAMILY . PREMIER KHALED EL-AZM, WHO LIVED BESIDE THE TURKISHEMBASSY, SIMPLY SLIPPED NEXT DOOR AND WAS GIVEN POLITICAL ASYLUM .DAMASCUS RADIO WENT ON THE AIR PROCLAIMING THE BAATHIST SLOGANS OF "UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM ! " A JUBILANT SYRIAN ARMY OFFICER AT ABORDER POST SAID, " WE WANT UNITY, NOT WITH NASSER, BUT WITH ALL ARABS. " AS IN IRAQ, THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTIONARYCOMMAND INSISTED ON ANONYMITY . THE NEW 20-MAN CABINET HAS ONLY TWOMILITARY MEN, AND THE BAATH PARTY IS STRONGLY REPRESENTED . NEW PREMIERSALAH EL-BITAR, 45, IS A FORMER SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND A BAATHISTWITH STRONG SYMPATHIES TOWARD ARAB UNITY . A TALL, HULKING DAMASCENEWITH DARK, BROODING EYES AND BRILLIANTINED HAIR, HE ONCE SIGNED AMANIFESTO DENOUNCING UNION WITH EGYPT, BUT LATER ADVOCATED CLOSEFEDERAL TIES .TWO IN ONE . TWO REVOLUTIONS WITHIN ASINGLE MONTH HAVE THUS PUT THE BAATHISTS INTO POWER IN TWO NATIONSSTRETCHING FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE PERSIAN GULF . THE BAATH PARTYSTRONGLY EMPHASIZES UNITY WITH ALL ARAB STATES, INCLUDING EGYPT, BUTREJECTS DICTATORSHIP BY ANYONE, INCLUDING NASSER . ITS PHILOSOPHY CALLSFOR ITTIHAD, LOOSE FEDERATION, AND PLEDGES OVERALL ALLEGIANCE TO URUBA,A PERVASIVE PANARABISM . WHEN NEWS OF THE SYRIAN REVOLT REACHED THEIRAQI CAPITAL OF BAGHDAD, A MILITARY PARADE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AVICTORY CELEBRATION, WITH LONG LINES OF CITIZENS AND STUDENTSSNAKE-DANCING THROUGH THE CITY . IN CAIRO, NASSER'S MEN HAILED THE NEWSYRIAN REGIME . IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NASSER WILL PROFIT FROM HIS PASTMISTAKES AND SETTLE FOR A COALITION OF " LIBERATED " ARAB STATESGOVERNED BY BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSERITES BUT RETAINING THEIR SEPARATEIDENTITIES AND SOVEREIGNTIES . THE REVOLUTIONARY WAVE NEXT THREATENSTHE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH HAVE BITTERLY OPPOSEDNASSER'S INTERVENTION IN YEMEN AND HAVE NO LOVE FOR THE UNITY PROPOSALSOF THE BAATH PARTY . THE BELEAGUERED KINGDOMS LAST WEEK SEEMED TO BEGIRDING FOR A LAST-DITCH STAND . KING HUSSEIN ALERTED HIS ARAB LEGION,THE MOST EFFICIENT FIGHTING FORCE IN THE ARAB WORLD . PRINCE FEISAL,PREMIER OF SAUDI ARABIA, PROTESTED THAT EGYPTIAN PLANES HAD BOMBEDSAUDI TOWNS ON THE YEMEN BORDER AND ANGRILY DECLARED, " LET THE WORLDKNOW THAT WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF WAR . WE SAUDIS ARE INDEED THE CHILDRENOF WAR . IF WE HAVE TO DIE, THEN LET US DIE WITH HONOR . UNLESS THESEATTACKS, PROVOCATIONS AND CHILDISH ACTS END, THEN THIS COUNTRY WILLTURN THE TABLES AND TURN THE AGGRESSORS HEAD OVER HEELS . " POSITIVEWAY . THE UNITED NATIONS' SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, DR . RALPHBUNCHE, LAST WEEK VISITED THE REPUBLICAN AREAS OF YEMEN AS PART OF THEU.N . EFFORT TO PREVENT THE ARKANSAS-SIZED NATION FROM BECOMING ANINTERNATIONAL BATTLEGROUND . YEMEN HAD DELAYED BUNCHE'S VISIT UNTIL ANEGYPTIAN ARMORED COLUMN COULD SEIZE THE FORMERLY ROYALIST-HELD TOWN OFMARIB, AND THEN EXHIBITED IT TO BUNCHE AS EVIDENCE OF REPUBLICANCONTROL OF THE COUNTRY . AFTER A 60-MINUTE SESSION WITH YEMEN'SSTRONGMAN ABDULLAH SALLAL, BUNCHE DECLARED, " I WAS MOST IMPRESSED BYHIS EARNESTNESS, SINCERITY, STRENGTH AND SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE . "STOPPING OFF IN CAIRO ON HIS WAY HOME,BUNCHE CONFERRED FOR TWO HOURS WITH NASSER, THEN SAW NEWSMEN . HEEMPHASIZED THAT THE YEMENI PEOPLE HE SAW SUPPORTED SALLAL'S GOVERNMENT/ IN A POSITIVE WAY . " THE RADIO VOICE OF THE ROYALIST TRIBESMENFIGHTING TO RESTORE THE IMAM PLAINTIVELY BEGGED BUNCHE TO VISIT THEAREAS THEY CONTROLLED " AND SEE THE REAL TRUTH SEE THE ROADS, RAVINESAND MOUNTAINS OF YEMEN LITTERED WITH EGYPTIAN DEAD . " BUT, ON THISTRIP AT LEAST, RALPH BUNCHE WAS SATISFIED TO DRAW HIS CONCLUSIONS FROMONE SIDE ONLY . LATER, THE U.N . LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE PLANS TO VISITTHE IMAM ON A SEPARATE JOURNEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE . HARD LOOK . IN1958, THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A BIG REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS IN THE MIDDLEEAST, THE U.S . RUSHED 14,000 MARINES AND TROOPS TO LEBANON . LAST WEEKTHE U.S . ROLE WAS FAR MORE AMBIVALENT . WASHINGTON SENT A MESSAGE TONASSER EXPRESSING " GRAVE CONCERN " AT CONTINUED EGYPTIAN BOMBING OFSAUDI ARABIA . INSTEAD OF MARINES, THE U.S . SENT VETERAN DIPLOMATELLSWORTH BUNKER TO SAUDI ARABIA TO REASSURE THE UNDERSTANDABLY NERVOUSPRINCE FEISAL . U.S . POLICY SEEMS AIMED AT SAFEGUARDING THETERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA FROM AGGRESSION BEYONDTHEIR BORDERS, NOT IN MAINTAINING THE MONARCHS IN POWER AGAINST THEIROWN PEOPLE . IN ISRAEL, PREMIER DAVID BENGURION INTERRUPTED A VACATIONTO CONFER WITH HIS DEFENSE CHIEFS . THE REVOLUTION IN SYRIA IS UNLIKELYTO BE THE FINAL FIRECRACKER ON THE STRING . BAATHIST AND NASSERITEELEMENTS ARE KNOWN TO BE AT WORK IN JORDAN, ESPECIALLY AMONG THEPALESTINIAN ARABS . SAUDI ARABIA CAN NO LONGER TRUST ITS SMALL AIRFORCE OR EVEN THE OFFICER CORPS OF ITS REGULAR ARMY . IF IT COMES TOFIGHTING, THE SAUDI RULERS WILL DEPEND ON THEIR " WHITE ARMY, " THEBEDOUIN TRIBESMEN TRADITIONALLY LOYAL TO THE KING . BUT IF THE ROADAHEAD LOOKS ROUGH FOR THE MONARCHIES, IT BY NO MEANS IS SMOOTH FOR THE/ LIBERATED " STATES, SINCE VICTORY MOST OFTEN PRESENTS ONLY NEWOCCASIONS FOR QUARRELS, IN KEEPING WITH THE ARAB PROVERB THAT SAYS, " IAND MY BROTHER AGAINST MY COUSIN ; I AND MY COUSIN AGAINST THEFOREIGNER . /
