GREAT BRITAIN A FOOLISH DISPLAY FOR THREE DAYSLONDON'S GENTEEL WEST END LOOKED LIKE A BATTLEFIELD . NEAR BUCKINGHAMPALACE, SQUADS OF POLICE GRAPPLED WITH LEATHER-JACKETED TOUGHS, WHILECHAUFFEURED BENTLEYS DELICATELY INCHED THEIR WAY THROUGH . WILD-EYEDGIRLS WITH STRAGGLY BLACK HAIR AND BLUEJEANED BOYS WITH GOLDEN TRESSESWERE FROG-WALKED INTO PADDY WAGONS . SOME 200 PEOPLE WERE JAILED .TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAOS, A SIX-MAN GANG WAYLAID THE DOWAGERDUCHESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND, SPED OFF IN A WHITE JAGUAR WITH HER JEWELS,WORTH $200,000 . MOST SHOCKING OF ALL, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HERELEVEN-YEAR REIGN, QUEEN ELIZABETH II WAS BOOED BY HER OWN PEOPLE .CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS THE LONGEXPECTED, LONG-DISPUTED STATE VISIT TOBRITAIN BY GREECE'S KING PAUL AND QUEEN FREDERIKA . FEARING PRECISELYTHE KIND OF LEFT-WING DEMONSTRATIONS THAT OCCURRED LAST WEEK, GREEKPREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS ADVISED AGAINST THE TRIP, RESIGNED WHENTHE ROYAL COUPLE REFUSED TO BOW TO PRESSURE AND DECIDED TO GO ANYWAY .BRITISH POLITICAL CRITICS BASE THEIR CASE AGAINST THE KING AND QUEENLARGELY ON THE FACT THAT GREEK JAILS STILL CONTAIN ABOUT 1,000PRISONERS SEIZED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO DURING THE CIVIL WAR ; MOSTARE BELIEVED TO BE COMMUNIST, AND THE GREEKS POINT OUT THAT THEY AREBEING GRADUALLY RELEASED ANYWAY (THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF PRISONERS WAS4,000) . THE QUEEN IS ALSO ACCUSED OF NAZI SYMPATHIES, AN OLD ANDABSURDLY EXAGGERATED CHARGE, AND OF MEDDLING TOO MUCH IN GREEKPOLITICS, HARDLY A BRITISH CONCERN . THE ANTIGREEK CHORUS IS MADE UP OFA MOTLEY COLLECTION OF COMMUNISTS, SOCIALISTS, ANTI-MONARCHISTS, VAGUECRUSADERS IN SEARCH OF NEW CAUSES, BAN-THE-BOMBERS (INCLUDING THATFOOLISH SAGE, BERTRAND RUSSELL), ALL OF THEM JOINED IN THE LONDONSTREETS BY JOY-RIDING BEATNIKS . AMAZINGLY, THEY WERE ALSO JOINED, INSPIRIT, BY LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON AND DEPUTY LEADER GEORGEBROWN, WHO CHOSE TO BOYCOTT A BANQUET FOR THE VISITORS WHICH COULD ONLYRAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND STABILITY OF BRITISHPOLITICS . BORNPRINCESS OF HANOVER, FREDERIKA IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF KAISER WILHELM II(AND A GREAT-GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRITAIN'S QUEEN VICTORIA, WHICHALSO MAKES HER A BRITISH PRINCESS AND A THIRD COUSIN OF QUEENELIZABETH) .

IN SCHOOL IN ITALY DURING HER LATE TEENS, AT A TIME WHENTHREE OF HER BROTHERS SERVED IN THE WEHRMACHT, SHE WAS HEARD TO DEFENDNAZI GERMANY . THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY FACT CRITICS CAN CITE TO SUPPORTTHEIR CASE . AFTER MARRYING PAUL IN 1938, FREDERIKA FLED GREECE UNDERNAZI BOMBARDMENT, LIVED IN EXILE IN EGYPT AND SOUTH AFRICA TILL WAR'SEND .AGENTS IN OVERALLS . FOR THE ROYALVISIT, THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT MOUNTED A SECURITY FORCE THAT OUTDIDEVEN THE BULGANIN-KHRUSHCHEV WELCOME IN 1956 . ON HAND WERE 5,000POLICE, INCLUDING PLAINCLOTHESMEN DISGUISED IN EVERYTHING FROM MORNINGCOATS TO OVERALLS . AS THE ROYAL PROCESSION OF CARRIAGES CLIPCLOPPEDFROM VICTORIA STATION, WHERE ELIZABETH GREETED THEM, TO BUCKINGHAMPALACE, A WOMAN BURST FROM THE CROWD AND SHRIEKED : " RELEASE MYHUSBAND ! " SHE TURNED OUT TO BE MRS . BETTY AMBATIELOS, 45, THEENGLISH WIFE OF ANTONIOS AMBATIELOS, A GREEK COMMUNIST SERVING A LIFETERM FOR HIS PART IN THE CIVIL WAR . THAT NIGHT, WHILE THE ROYALCOUPLES AND 156 OTHER GUESTS DINED IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE, 2,000DEMONSTRATORS POURED INTO TRAFALGAR SQUARE WITH BANNERS PROCLAIMING "DOWN WITH THE NAZI QUEEN . " THE CROWD SEEMED BENT ON STORMING THEPALACE BUT ENCOUNTERED MASSED LINES OF BOBBIES BLOCKING THE WAY .POLICE HELMETS CLATTERED ACROSS SIDEWALKS, FISTS FLEW, TRAFFIC STALLED,AND PRANCING POLICE HORSES BOWLED OVER CROWDS . RIOTERS FOUGHT OFF COPSFROM ATOP A DOUBLEDECK BUS . A FEW YOUTHS WHO MADE IT TO THE MALL WERESTOPPED BY FLYING TACKLES . " SEIG HEIL ! " FOR THE NEXT NIGHT, SOTHAT THE ROYAL PARTY COULD SEE SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAMIN NEAR-PERFECT SECURITY, THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAD BOUGHT UP ALL 1,100TICKETS TO THE ALDWYCH THEATER, DISTRIBUTED THEM TO A SELECT AUDIENCETHAT INCLUDED LEADERS OF LONDON'S GREEK COMMUNITY . SHORTLY BEFORECURTAIN TIME, A FALSE REPORT THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN PLANTED IN THETHEATER LED TO THE ADDITIONAL SPECTACLE OF POLICE IN EVENING CLOTHESCOMBING THE ROYAL BOX WITH A MINE DETECTOR . HELD BACK BY SIX ROWS OFPOLICE, 1,500 PEOPLE OUTSIDE GREETED THE ROYAL ARRIVALS WITH AN UGLYDIN OF BOOS, HISSES AND MOCKING SHOUTS OF " SIEG HEIL ! " AND "FASCIST SWINE . " THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CHEERED . AFTER THE PLAY, QUEENELIZABETH LEFT THE THEATER ALONE, AND WAS GREETED BY ANOTHER CHORUS OFBOOS . SHE LOOKED STARTLED AND DISMAYED . IT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRSTTIME THAT BRITISH ROYALTY HAD BEEN SO PUBLICLY HUMILIATED AT HOME SINCEEDWARD VII WAS HISSED AT EPSOM IN THE LAST CENTURY AFTER RUMOR INVOLVEDHIM AS A CORRESPONDENT IN A DIVORCE CASE . WORSE THAN WOOLLY . NEXTDAY, GREEK PREMIER PANAYOTIS PIPINELIS, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE KING ANDQUEEN, GRANTED MRS . AMBATIELOS A 45-MINUTE HEARING, WHEREUPON SHECALMED DOWN . BACK IN GREECE, 19 OF THE PRISONERS (NOT INCLUDINGAMBATIELOS) WERE FREED . AT WEEK'S END THE ROYAL COUPLE QUIETLYRETURNED TO GREECE . SAID FREDERIKA BEFORE SHE LEFT : " THE DECISIONTO COME TO BRITAIN FOR A STATE VISIT WAS THE RIGHT ONE, ABSOLUTELYRIGHT . I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THOSE FEW PEOPLE WHO DEMONSTRATED . THEMEMORY I HAVE IS OF THE WARM RECEPTION WE WERE GIVEN ON OUR ARRIVAL . "IN BRITAIN THE FOOLISH DISPLAY OF THE ANTI-GREEK DEMONSTRATORS LEFTUNPLEASANT ECHOES . THOSE BEHIND THE RIOTS, WROTE THE DAILY MIRROR, "ARE NOT MERELY LEADING WOOLLY-MINDED UNDERGRADUATES IN WOOLLY-MINDEDPEACE PROTESTS ; THEY ARE PROVIDING A SHIELD FOR MISCHIEVOUS COMMUNISTAGITATION . " THE PAPER NOTED THAT " GREECE IS ABOUT THE ONLY COUNTRYIN EASTERN EUROPE FREE FROM DICTATORSHIP, " THEN POSED A QUESTION THATSELF-ADVERTISED IDEALISTS HAVE YET TO ANSWER : WHEN WAS THE LAST TIMETHEY DEMONSTRATED IN BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PRISONERS OF LITHUANIA ORESTONIA OR LATVIA OR POLAND OR HUNGARY OR RUMANIA OR BULGARIA OR EASTGERMANY OR CZECHOSLOVAKIA ?
