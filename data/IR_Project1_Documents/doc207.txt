GREAT BRITAIN YER PAYS YER MONEY, YER TYKES YER CHOICEPSEPHOLOGY, AS GUESSING ELECTIONS IS CALLED IN BRITAIN, IS ABOUT ASINEXACT AN ART AS PLAYING THE FOOTBALL POOLS . FACED WITH A GENERALELECTION THIS YEAR OR NEXT, THE EXPERTS LAST WEEK STUDIED A RICH CROPOF AUGURIES WITH UNUSUAL DILIGENCE AND THE USUAL RESULTS : THEYDISAGREED . CERTAINLY, THERE WAS LITTLE TO ENCOURAGE PRIME MINISTERHAROLD MACMILLAN'S CONSERVATIVES IN THE OUTCOME OF 401 LOCAL BOROUGHELECTIONS . WITH 2,973 SEATS AT STAKE, THE TORIES LOST A TOTAL OF 550; THE LABOR PARTY GAINED 544, WINNING CONTROL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INSUCH MAJOR CITIES AS LEICESTER, LIVERPOOL, BRADFORD, BRISTOL ANDNOTTINGHAM . LABOR OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT IF A GENERAL ELECTION WEREHELD TOMORROW, THEY WOULD RETURN TO POWER WITH A MARGIN OF 90 TO 130SEATS . ALSO LAST WEEK, HOWEVER, THREE SEPARATE OPINION POLLS INDICATEDTHAT LABOR'S LEAD HAS SHORTENED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST MONTH . ADAILY MAIL SURVEY ESTIMATED THAT TORY SUPPORT HAS INCREASED A STARTLING7 PER CENT SINCE APRIL . THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GALLUP POLL REPORTED A 2.5PER CENT GAIN FOR THE CONSERVATIVES, WHOSE SUPPORT IS NOW ESTIMATED AT36.5 PER CENT, TO LABOR'S 46.5 PER CENT THE CLUES WERE NOT QUITE ASCONTRADICTORY AS THEY SEEMED . COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN BRITAIN GENERALLYMIRROR LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS . WHILE TORY CANDIDATES WERE HURT BYHIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN MANY BIG CITIES, THEY ALSO TOOK A BEATINGIN MANY PROSPEROUS SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE HOUSEHOLDERS WERE STILLCROSS WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR RECENTLY INCREASING THEIR LOCAL TAXES(FROM 50 PER CENT TO 300 PER CENT ) . NATIONAL OPINION POLLS, WHICH INTHE PAST HAVE PROVED FAIRLY ACCURATE, APPARENTLY REFLECTED BRITONS'SATISFACTION WITH A NEW HEAD OF STEAM THAT HAS BEGUN TO APPEAR IN THEECONOMY . TORN BETWEEN CONTRADICTORY PORTENTS, PSEPHOLOGISTS ANDPOLITICIANS WERE ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE GENERAL ELECTIONWILL BE HELD THIS FALL OR NEXT YEAR .
