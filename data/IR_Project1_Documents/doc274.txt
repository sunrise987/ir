RUSSIA WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT TO HEAR THE RUSSIANS TELL IT, ALL THEWORLD'S WOMEN WERE IN CHAINS BEFORE VALENTINA VLADIMIROVNA TERESHKOVA .AS THE FIRST WOMAN COSMONAUT LOOPED THE EARTH, TASS EXULTED : " ABRILLIANT STAR HAS FLARED UP IN THE COSMIC FIRMAMENT . IT OUTSHINES ALLTHE FILM STARS IN THE WORLD . NEVER AND IN NO COUNTRY DID WOMEN EVERATTAIN SUCH HEIGHT . " IN EVERY RUSSIAN VILLAGE, WOMEN CELEBRATED, ANDCONGRATULATIONS WERE FIRED ALOFT FROM SUCH SOVIET HEROINES AS LYUBI LI,DESCRIBED IN THE PRESS AS " THE RENOWNED CORN PLANTER AND HEROOF SOCIALIST LABOR . " IN HER SPACE CAPSULE, VOSTOK VI, " VALYA " WASSTILL THE COMPLEAT SOVIET WOMAN . HER SPACE SUIT WAS EMBROIDERED WITH ASNOW-WHITE DOVE, AND SHE HAD HAD HER HAIR DONE BEFORE BLASTOFF . ONCE ATOMBOY, SHE NOW HAS AN ADMITTED WEAKNESS FOR SPIKED HEELS, STYLISHCLOTHES, AND A PERFUME CALLED RED MOSCOW . FROM SPACE SHE RADIOEDGROUND CONTROL : " PLEASE TELL MAMMA NOT TO WORRY . " ONCE, WHENGROUND SCIENTISTS LOST CONTACT WITH " SEAGULL " (VALYA'S ORBITAL CALLNAME), THEY HASTILY ORDERED HER COSMIC COMPANION IN VOSTOK V, LIEUT .COLONEL VALERY FEODOROVICH BYKOVSKY, TO TRY AND ROUSE HER . " SORRY, IWAS HAVING A SNOOZE, " APOLOGIZED VALYA . MISSED RENDEZVOUS . OVERTHEIR RADIOS, VALYA AND VALERY SANG SONGS OF FRIENDSHIP TO EACH OTHER,FLASHED " BEST WISHES TO THE INDUSTRIOUS AMERICAN PEOPLE " AND " WARMGREETINGS TO THE MULTIMILLIONED CHINESE . " LOOSENING THEIR HARNESSES,BOTH COSMONAUTS PERFORMED CALISTHENICS WHILE FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY INTHEIR CABINS . BUT THOUGH THE TWO VOSTOKS PASSED WITHIN THREE MILES OFEACH OTHER, THEIR ORBITAL PATHS WERE SO DIVERGENT THAT THEY COULD NOTRENDEZVOUS . SINCE U.S . SCIENTISTS HAD FULLY EXPECTED THE TWO CAPSULESTO LINK UP IN SPACE, THEY SPECULATED THAT SOVIET SCIENTISTS HAD MADE ALAUNCHING MISCALCULATION . THREE DAYS AND 48 ORBITS AFTER TAKEOFF,VALYA RE-ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE, WAS EJECTED FROM HER CAPSULE ANDFLOATED TO EARTH BY PARACHUTE NEAR A SMALL VILLAGE IN KAZAKHSTAN ;SLOWED BY ANOTHER PARACHUTE, THE EMPTY VOSTOK VI LANDED NEAR BY . TWOHOURS AND 46 MINUTES LATER AND SOME 500 MILES AWAY, BYKOVSKY LANDEDSIMILARLY IN THE MEADOW OF A COLLECTIVE FARM AFTER A RECORD 81 ORBITSAND 119 HOURS ALOFT . BUT BYKOVSKY WAS ALL BUT FORGOTTEN IN THE FUROROVER VALYA . TELEVISION COMMENTATORS DESCRIBED HER " CORNFLOWER BLUEEYES, " AND PEASANTS SHOWERED HER WITH BOUQUETS . OVERCOME BY HERWELCOME, VALYA BROKE INTO TEARS ; IT WAS THE FIRST TIME, MOSCOWASSURED THE WORLD, THAT ANYONE HAD SEEN HER CRY SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD .IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, SHE ADMITTED THATSHE HAD BRUISED HER NOSE IN LANDING, SAID THAT THE " PEOPLE RECEIVED MEVERY CORDIALLY IN THE RUSSIAN MANNER WITH BREAD AND SALT . "FORESIGHTEDLY, SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG PHOTOGRAPHS OF HERSELF AND PASSEDTHEM OUT TO WORKERS WHO GREETED HER, GIVING MOST OF THE PICTURES TOWOMEN . " I PREFER WOMEN TODAY, " SHE SAID . " THE MEN SHOULDN'TCOMPLAIN . " WHEN SHE FLEW INTO MOSCOW FOR HER OFFICIAL RECEPTION THREEDAYS LATER, VALYA WAS GREETED BY MORE FLOWERS THAN ANYONE HAD EVERREMEMBERED SEEING BEFORE IN THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL, A BEAR HUG AND KISSFROM KHRUSHCHEV, AND HER BEST BEAU, BACHELOR COSMONAUT ANDRIANNIKOLAYEV . PAPER DOLLS . THOUGH RUSSIA'S SECOND DOUBLE SHOT ADDEDLITTLE NEW TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY, THE FACT THAT VALYA WAS NOT A PILOT ANDADMITTEDLY WAS MECHANICALLY UNSOPHISTICATED RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHYU.S . ASTRONAUTS ALL MUST BE SKILLED TEST PILOTS . THE ANSWER FROM NASAOFFICIALS : USE OF TEST PILOTS PERMITS THE ELIMINATION OFSPACE-CONSUMING AUTOMATIC EQUIPMENT IN THE CRAMPED CAPSULES . BUT SOMEAUTHORITIES ARE CONVINCED THAT YOUNG SCIENTISTS WOULD BE FAR MOREEFFECTIVE IN OBSERVING AND ANALYZING UNEXPECTED SPACE FLIGHTPHENOMENA. SAYS CLINTON ANDERSON, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE SPACECOMMITTEE : " THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROVED TO US THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TOHAVE 20 YEARS OF TEST-PILOT EXPERIENCE BEFORE YOU CAN HANDLE ONE OFTHESE CAPSULES FERVENT AGREEMENT WAS VOICED BY U.S . FEMINISTS . SAIDJANE HART, WIFE OF MICHIGAN SENATOR PHILIP HART AND LEADER IN THE FIGHTTO GET WOMEN ASTRONAUTS ACCEPTED BY SOLIDLY MISOGYNISTIC NASA : " I'MTEMPTED TO GO OUT TO THE BARN AND TELL THE STORY TO MY HORSE AND LISTENTO HIM LAUGH . " ADDED CLARE BOOTHE LUCE : " WE MUST STOP TRYING TOMAKE PAPER DOLLS OF OUR WOMEN . " ANTHROPOLOGIST MARGARET MEAD WARNED: " THE RUSSIANS TREAT MEN AND WOMEN INTERCHANGEABLY . WE TREAT MENAND WOMEN DIFFERENTLY . " AND VIVE LA DIFFERENCE, SAID AT LEAST ONERUSSIAN MALE LAST WEEK . " MY AGE AND CONSERVATIVE MENTAL MAKEUPCOMPELLED ME TO THINK UP TO THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT WE MEN WERE THERULERS OF MAN'S MIND AND THE SALT OF THE EARTH, " SAID NOVELIST MIKHAIL(AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON) SHOLOKHOV . " AND WHAT DO WE SEE NOW ? AWOMAN IN SPACE ! SAY WHAT YOU WILL, THIS IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE . ITCONTRADICTS ALL MY SET CONCEPTIONS OF THE WORLD AND ITS POSSIBILITIES .MANY SCIENTISTSDOUBT ASTRONAUT GORDON COOPER'S REPORT OF SEEING TRUCKS ON THE ROADAND SMOKE COMING OUT OF CHIMNEYS IN TIBET . ACCORDING TO DR . W . R .ADEY OF U.C.L.A., THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO SEEING OBJECTS 1 IN . INDIAMETER 4,000 FT . AWAY . HE THINKS COOPER HAD DISORDERS OF VISION ORJUDGMENT .
