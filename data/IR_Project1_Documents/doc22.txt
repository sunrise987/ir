ITALY ADJUSTING THE APERTURA EVER SINCE PREMIER AMINTOREFANFANI TEAMED UP WITH PIETRO NENNI'S SOCIALISTS ALMOST A YEAR AGO TOFORM ITALY'S APERTURA A SINISTRA ( " OPENING TO THE LEFT " ), THEUNEASY ALLIANCE HAS BEEN CLOUDED BY A SINGLE ISSUE : NENNI'S DEMANDFOR THE CREATION OF 15 REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS THAT HE FIGURES WILLBOOST HIS PARTY'S GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT . FANFANI AGREED TO PAY NENNI'SPRICE BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE SOCIALISTS' 88 VOTES IN THE CHAMBER OFDEPUTIES IN ORDER TO STAY IN POWER, BUT HE STALLED ON ENACTING THESCHEME JUST THE SAME . FANFANI FEARED THAT THE SOCIALISTS WOULD SIGNLOCAL ELECTORAL AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNISTS AND THEREBY CONVERT THE NEWREGIONS INTO LEFTIST STRONGHOLDS . EVEN AFTER NENNI PLEDGED NOT TOCOOPERATE WITH THE REDS, MANY OF FANFANI'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS REMAINEDSKEPTICAL OF HIS PROMISE . WITH NENNI DEMANDING QUICK ACTION ON THEREGIONAL PLAN, THE LOOMING ALTERNATIVE WAS COMPROMISE OR COLLAPSE OFTHE COALITION . LAST WEEK FANFANI ACTED . AFTER NINE HOURS OF ARGUMENT,CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AND THEIR TWO SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS AGREED TOINTRODUCE PROMPTLY TWO BILLS COVERING TAXATION AND ADMINISTRATION OFTHE REGIONS ; THEY POSTPONED LEGISLATION ACTUALLY CREATING THEM UNTILA NEW PARLIAMENT CONVENES AFTER NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN MAY . THESOCIALISTS GRUMBLED BITTERLY, BUT NENNI URGED THEM TO BIDE THEIR TIME ./ IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT CRISIS, " HE TOLD A MEETING OFHIS PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, " IT'S NOT GOING TO BE CAUSED BY US . "NENNI HAS HIS EYE ON A CABINET POST IN A NEW GOVERNMENT ; CAUSING ACRISIS AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE, FOR FANFANI THIS WEEK GOESOFF TO VISIT JOHN F . KENNEDY, AND IN A FORTNIGHT HAROLD MACMILLANARRIVES IN ROME . FELLOW TRAVELERS IN THE SOCIALIST HIGH COMMAND WEREWILLING, EVEN ANXIOUS, TO TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT, BUT AS THE PARTYCONTINUED ITS TALKS AT WEEK'S END, IT APPEARED THAT NENNI AND THECOALITION WOULD SQUEAK THROUGH .
