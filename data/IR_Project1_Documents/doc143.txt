THIS WAS ELARD'S OWN MYSTICAL VERSION OF WHAT SOMEMIGHT CONSIDER MERELY A CASE OF MURDER FOR PAY . THE GIRL'SGRANDFATHER, ODRECK KASOCI, HAD SOUGHT OUT ELARD TO GET RID OF THEANNOYING CHILD BECAUSE ELARD WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS A "MAGIC MAN, " AND THEREFORE QUALIFIED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM .

" SIR EDGAR WASFACED WITH ANOTHER CLASSIC CLASH OF WHITE MAN'S RULES WITH DEEPROOTEDAFRICAN BELIEFS .
