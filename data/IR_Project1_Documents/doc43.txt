ALGERIA THE HIGH COST OF INDEPENDENCE NOT LONG AGO, THEWEST WAS READY TO WRITE OFF ALGERIA'S BRASH, SLOGANEERING PREMIER AHMEDBEN BELLA AS A MEDITERRANEAN CASTRO RIPE FOR RED DOMINATION . BUT TIMESDO CHANGE . AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF INDEPENDENCE, BEN BELLA NOW RELIES ONA TIDE OF AID FROM THE WEST, NOT THE EAST, TO KEEP HIS STRUGGLINGCOUNTRY AFLOAT . ONLY LAST WEEK, FINANCE MINISTER AHMED FRANCISRETURNED FROM PARIS WITH PLEDGES OF $280 MILLION IN FRENCH AID FOR 1963.AT THE SAME TIME, THE U.S . TENTATIVELY AGREED TO LAUNCH A FOODRELIEF PROGRAM FOR HARDHIT ALGERIAN PEASANTS ; BEN BELLA HOPES THISCAN BE BROADENED INTO A SWEEPING PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC AID BEFORE LONG .EMPTIED BY WAR . RAVAGED BY 7F YEARS OF WAR WITH FRANCE, THE BLOODYS.A.O . TERROR AND A FRATRICIDAL POWER STRUGGLE THAT SOURED THE FIRSTMONTHS OF INDEPENDENCE, ALGERIA NEEDS EVERY CENTIME IT CAN GET . ONLYONE ALGERIAN IN TEN HAS A STEADY JOB . THE ILLITERACY RATE IS 90 PERCENT . OFFICIALS FIGURE THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS AT LEAST $2 BILLION TOREBUILD, BUT THE TREASURY IS BARE . SAID BEN BELLA : " WE ARE ACOUNTRY EMPTIED BY WAR . " TO FILL IT UP AGAIN, BEN BELLA NEEDS WESTERNHELP . AT FIRST, EMBITTERED BY HIS 5F YEARS IN FRENCH PRISONS, HEBLINKERED HIMSELF TO THAT FACT . HE THREATENED TO TURN ALL REMAININGFRENCH-OWNED LANDS INTO STATE-RUN FARMS . HE SAUNTERED OFF TO HAVANA TOEMBRACE FIDEL CASTRO RIGHT AFTER A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY . HEACCEPTED WHAT LITTLE RED AID HE GOT WITH GREAT FANFARE, BUTDELIBERATELY PLAYED DOWN FAR MORE EXTENSIVE HELP FROM THE WESTINCLUDING A FLOOD OF FOOD SHIPMENTS FROM PRIVATE U.S . CHARITIES THATHAVE KEPT NEARLY HALF OF HIS 10 MILLION PEOPLE FROM STARVING . BUTBENEATH THE BLUSTER BEN BELLA IS MORE PRAGMATIST THAN DOGMATIST, ANDALGERIA'S SORRY STATE PERSUADED HIM TO BEGIN TACKING WITH THE WESTERNWIND . " HE IS DETERMINED TO FEED, CLOTHE AND EMPLOY HIS PEOPLE, " SAIDONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT, " AND HE'S GOING TO KICK OVER ANY " ISMS' THATGET IN HIS WAY . " OVER THE PROTESTS OF MILITANT MARXISTS, HE BEGANPROMOTING " HEALTHY COOPERATION " WITH FRANCE, SOUGHT INCREASED AID . "THEY ARE DUTY BOUND TO HELP US RECONSTRUCT, " HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEWWITH TIME CORRESPONDENT JAMES WILDE . " THIS WOULD HELP DISSIPATE ALLTHAT WENT BEFORE . " FRANCE IS COMMITTED TO GIVE ALGERIA A MINIMUM OF$200 MILLION A YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND IS SPONSORING ITSASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMON MARKET . NEARLY 90 PER CENT OF THE1,200,000 EUROPEANS WHO ONCE TENDED ALGERIA'S VINEYARDS AND RAN ITSBUSINESSES HAVE FLED (ALONG WITH SOME 200,000 JOB-SEEKING MOSLEMS), BUTOFFICIALS NOW ARE ANXIOUS TO LURE BACK TEACHERS, TECHNICIANS ANDADMINISTRATORS TO HELP STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MESS . YEAR OF AUSTERITY . TOSTRENGTHEN HIS SHAKY POSITION, BEN BELLA IS CLEARING THE FIELD OFOPPOSITION BY PERSUASION WHERE POSSIBLE, FORCE WHERE NECESSARY . HE HASBANNED ALL PARTIES EXCEPT HIS NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (F.L.N.) .FORTNIGHT AGO, HE OUSTED EXTREME LEFTIST LEADERS OF THE 300,000-MEMBERGENERAL UNION OF ALGERIAN WORKERS BECAUSE THEY WERE RESISTING HISRAPPROCHEMENT WITH FRANCE, REPLACED THEM WITH TRUSTED PRO-GOVERNMENTMEN . THOUGH THE PROBLEMS OF REGIONALISM AND MARAUDING GUERRILLAS STILLPLAGUE HIM, HE HAS MANAGED TO WIN OVER MOST OF THE HOSTILE TRIBALCHIEFTAINS IN THE HINTERLANDS TO HIS SIDE . BEN BELLA'S BIGGEST PROBLEMBY FAR IS THE ECONOMY . THIS YEAR, HE SAID, WILL BE ONE " OF AUSTERITY,OF CONVALESCENCE . " TO SHOW THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS, HE PUSHED THROUGHA SKIN-AND-BONES BUDGET OF $564 MILLION, GIVING SOME MINISTRIESONE-TENTH OF WHAT THEY HAD DEMANDED . HE ALSO PUT A $400-A-MONTHCEILING ON ALL GOVERNMENT SALARIES HIS OWN INCLUDED AND SLAPPED A 100PER PER CENT TAX ON INCOME ABOVE $800 A MONTH . TO THE ASCETIC BENBELLA, WHO LIVES IN A DINGY, THREE-ROOM BACHELOR FLAT WITH A NEPHEW WHODOES ALL THE COOKING AND CLEANING, THAT SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE .FOR THOSE WHO THINK OTHERWISE, HE HAS A STERN ANSWER . " THIS, " SAYSBEN BELLA, " IS THE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE . "
