FRANCE TO THE MINES ! FOR ALL THE EXCITED HEADLINES,S.A.O . TERRORISM WAS HARDLY CHARLES DE GAULLE'S MAIN CONCERN LAST WEEK. FAR GRAVER WAS THE CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY POSED BY FRANCE'SECONOMY . IT TOOK THE FORM OF A SPREADING LABOR STRIKE LED BY 188,000STUBBORN MINERS CONCENTRATED IN THE GRIM COAL DISTRICTS OF NORTHERNFRANCE . THREE RIVAL UNIONS (ROMAN CATHOLIC, SOCIALIST, COMMUNIST) WEREOUT OF THE PITS IN A JOINT DEMAND FOR A 12 PER CENT PAY BOOST TOCOMPENSATE FOR THE CREEPING INFLATION THAT HAS WIPED OUT MUCH OF THEIRPURCHASING POWER IN THE PAST THREE YEARS . DE GAULLE'S REPLY WAS IN THEAUTHORITARIAN TRADITION OF AN ANGRY OLD SOLDIER . HE PUT HIS SIGNATURETO A SPECIAL DECREE THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF DRAFTING THE STRIKERS INTOTHE NATIONAL SERVICEORDERS CAN BE SIGNED BY THE PREMIER ; BY ISSUINGIT HIMSELF, DE GAULLE PUT HIS OWN PRESTIGE ON THE LINE AGAINST THESTRIKERS . AS STRATEGISTS, THE MINERS TURNED OUT TO BE WORTHY OPPONENTS. THOUGH TEMPTED TO STRIKE EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE SWIFTLY RISING COSTOF LIVING, THE MINERS HELD OFF UNTIL FRANCE'S COAL STOCKS HAD BEEN USEDUP BY THE BITTER COLD OF THE PAST MONTHS . WHEN THE STRIKE WAS ONLY AFEW DAYS OLD, FACTORIES BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN FROM LACK OF FUEL . SUPPORTFOR THE MINERS CAME FROM ALL SIDES . ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOP GERARDHUYGHE OF ARRAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEIR CONDITIONS MUST BE IMPROVED. IN PARIS, 3,000 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE STRIKERS,SHOUTING " DE GAULLE TO THE MINES ! " THE WINE DEALERS ASSOCIATIONPROMISED TO SEND 2,600 GALLONS OF RED WINE TO THE BEER-DRINKING MINERS. OTHER UNIONS PULLED SHORT SYMPATHY STRIKES : RAILROAD WORKERS QUITFOR 15 MINUTES ; GAS AND ELECTRIC WORKERS WALKED OUT FOR TWO HOURS,STALLING SUBWAYS, STOPPING WORK IN FACTORIES, TRAPPING SOME UNWARYCITIZENS IN ELEVATORS BETWEEN FLOORS . DE GAULLE'S REQUISITION ORDERISELF WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE SYMPATHY FOR THE MINERS . UNDERLAST WEEK'S DECREE, FAILURE TO RETURN TO WORK CAN BE PUNISHED BYDISMISSAL, FINES AND, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, JAIL TERMS . A COALCUTTER IN LENS SAID : " WE WERE STRIKING FOR MONEY AND SHORTER HOURS,BUT NOW WE'RE STRIKING FOR THE RIGHT TO STRIKE . " AT WEEK'S ENDPREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU TOOK HIS CASE TO THE PEOPLE IN A NATIONWIDETELEVISION BROADCAST, URGING THE MINERS TO RETURN TO WORK TO PROTECT "THE LIFE AND PROSPERITY OF THE NATION . " HE WAS STILL STANDING FIRM ONMONEY : " THE REASONABLE RHYTHM OF SALARY INCREASES PROHIBITS GIVINGTHE MINERS WHAT THEY ASK . " ALL THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PROMISE WAS A 5.7PER CENT BOOST SPREAD OVER TEN MONTHS .
