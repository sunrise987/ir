THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN . . . THE MORALS OF THE BRITISH HAVE ALWAYSINTRIGUED AND BAFFLED FOREIGNERS . FOR CENTURIES, EUROPEANS VISITINGTHAT COLD, CONTROLLED COUNTRY HAVE DISCOVERED TO THEIR AMAZEMENT ANDFREQUENT ENVY THAT THE ABUNDANCE, SUBTLETY AND VARIETY OF SEXUAL SPORTIN LONDON'S DEMIMONDE MAKE CONTINENTAL CAPITALS SEEM PAROCHIAL . UNTILRECENT YEARS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO DINNER AT LONDON'S MOSTFASHIONABLE CLUBS OR PRIVATE HOUSES WITHOUT PASSING SWARMS OFWELL-TURNED-OUT AND SOMETIMES HANDSOME STREETWALKERS STANDING GUARD ONTHE SIDEWALK . LIKE MANY ANOTHER FOREIGN ANALYST OF ANGLO-SAXONATTITUDES, FRENCH DIARIST HIPPOLYTE TAINE, VISITING LONDON IN THE MID19TH CENTURY, COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW THE ENGLISH COULD SUSTAIN THE "VEHEMENCE AND PUNGENCY OF THEIR PASSIONS " AGAINST " THE HARSH, THOUGHSILENT, GRINDING OF THEIR MORAL MACHINERY . " THERE IS A WIDESPREADFEELING THAT BRITAIN'S MORAL MACHINERY IS NOT GRINDING AS HARSHLY AS ITUSED TO . MUCH IN ENGLISH LIFE TODAY SUGGESTS DECADENCE AND DISSOLUTION. SINCE THE GIRLS WERE DRIVEN OFF THE STREETS FOUR YEARS AGO, THEY HAVETAKEN TO ADVERTISING THEIR SERVICES IN SHOP WINDOWS AS " MASSEUSES, " /MODELS, " OR " FRENCH TEACHERS . " LONDON'S BOOMING STRIPTEASE PARLORSOFFER SOME OF THE CRUDEST LIVE PORNOGRAPHY TO BE  SEEN PUBLICLY INEUROPE . ITS PARKS IN SUMMER ARE PRE-EMPTED BY COUPLES WHO AREN'T JUSTNECKING . ONE THIRD OF ALL TEEN-AGE BRIDES IN BRITAIN ARE ALREADYPREGNANT . INNUMERABLE SCANDALS PRECEDING THE PROFUMO CASE SUGGESTCONSIDERABLE PROMISCUITY, ALONG WITH SEXUAL ARRANGEMENTS INFINITELYMORE COMPLEX THAN THE OLD-FASHIONED TRIANGLE . AND, AS EVERYONE KNOWS,HOMOSEXUALITY IS " THE ENGLISH VICE . " PSYCHOLOGIST G . M . CARSTAIRSCOMMENTED RECENTLY : " POPULAR MORALITY IS NOW A WASTELAND, LITTEREDWITH THE DEBRIS OF BROKEN CONVENTIONS . CONCEPTS SUCH AS HONOR, OR EVENHONESTY, HAVE AN OLD-FASHIONED SOUND, BUT NOTHING HAS TAKEN THEIR PLACE. " GETTING CAUGHT . THIS HARSH JUDGMENT MAY OVERLOOK THE FACT THATBRITAIN WAS NEVER THE SORT OF PLACE VICTORIAN MORALITY PRETENDED IT WAS. IF LONDON TODAY RESEMBLES BABYLON-ON-THAMES, IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN ADE LUXE MODEL OF THE BRUTAL, CARNAL 18TH CENTURY CITY WHOSE BROTHELS,BOUDOIRS AND GIN SHOPS ( " DRUNK FOR A PENNY, DEAD DRUNK FOR TUPPENCE ") WERE PICTURED BY HOGARTH, RICHARDSON AND FIELDING . SAYS MALCOLMMUGGERIDGE : " THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A LOT OF HIGH-GRADE WHORING IN THISCOUNTRY, " AND THERE IS A LOT OF PAST EVIDENCE TO PROVE HIM RIGHT .GEORGE IV HAD HIS QUEEN TRIED PUBLICLY FOR INFIDELITY ; IN THE EARLY18TH CENTURY, AN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MAINTAINED A HAREM AT HIS PALACE .THE 18TH CENTURY CHRISTINE KEELER WAS A MISS CHUDLEIGH, WHO HAD BEENTHE MISTRESS OF THREE PEERS WHEN GEORGE II SPOTTED HER AT A COSTUMEBALL, CUNNINGLY DISGUISED IN A TRANSPARENT GOWN . HER GEORGIAN ERA CAMEBETWEEN TWO NOBLE MARRIAGES (ONE BIGAMOUS) . IN THE 18TH CENTURYPHRASE, BORROWED FROM NAUTICAL TERMINOLOGY, MISS CHUDLEIGH HAD "BOTTOM, " OR WHAT IT TAKES .INDEED, THE BRITISHRESERVE A SPECIAL ORDER OF VENERY FOR DISTINGUISHED DOXIES SUCH AS EMMAHAMILTON, THE ONETIME STREETWALKER WHO FOR YEARS WAS CIVILLY SHARED BYHER AMBASSADOR HUSBAND, SIR WILLIAM, AND ADMIRAL LORD NELSON, THEFATHER OF HER DAUGHTER . ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL HIGH-SOCIETYHUSTLERS WAS HARRIETTE WILSON, A REGENCY BEAUTY WHOSE GUEST REGISTERWOULD HAVE READ LIKE BURKE'S PEERAGE ; WHEN SHE STARTED PUBLISHING HERMEMOIRS, SHE MANAGED TO COLLECT DOUBLE DIVIDENDS FROM MANY FORMERPATRONS WHO PREFERRED NOT TO BE IMMORTALIZED . BUT NOT THE IRON DUKE OFWELLINGTON, WHO, WHEN TOLD BY HARRIETTE THAT SHE PLANNED TO CHRONICLEHIS INDISCRETIONS, ROARED : " PUBLISH AND BE DAMNED ! " SHE DID .SINCE THE MID-19TH CENTURY, SIN FOR A POLITICIAN HAS MEANT GETTINGCAUGHT AT IT . AT LEAST THREE OFFICIALLY VIRTUOUS PRIME MINISTERS, LORDPALMERSTON, ARTHUR BALFOUR AND LLOYD GEORGE, WERE INVETERATE ADULTERERS. THUS THE STATE OF SEXUAL MORALITY IN BRITAIN TODAY IS PROBABLY NOWORSE THAN IT EVER WAS, AND THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE THAT IT IS BETTER .BRITAIN MAY NOT BE A MORAL WASTELAND BUT A BATTLEGROUND IN WHICH A MOREREALISTIC, LESS HYPOCRITICAL GENERATION IS ATTEMPTING TO WIN LEGAL ANDSOCIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FACTS OF EVERYDAY LIFE . SPARING THE HORSES .WITH THE LOSS OF EMPIRE AND THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH AS AN INFLUENCEIN SOCIETY, BRITONS HAVE TEMPERED THEIR OLD MORAL CERTITUDES . AUTHORJAMES MORRIS FEARS THAT HIS COMPATRIOTS ARE BECOMING " CONGENITALLYINCAPABLE OF DISREGARDING THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW, ARE CONSTANTLYGROUPING TOWARD SOME GENERAL SYNTHESIS OF EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW ONEVERYTHING . " BUT THE STIR CREATED BY THE PROFUMO CASE SUGGESTS THATTHERE IS STILL A LOT OF POWER LEFT IN THE " MORAL MACHINERY . " WHATHAS REALLY CHANGED IN BRITAIN ARE MATTERS OF STYLE AND OUTLOOK, OFCLASS AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE . FORNICATION HAS ALWAYS SEEMED MORESPECTACULAR IN THE UPPER AND LOWER REACHES OF SOCIETY . BUT NOW, SAYS D. W . BROGAN, " IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASSES ARE TAKING UPTHE VICES OF THEIR BETTERS AND ALSO OF THEIR INFERIORS . " IF THERE ISNO LONGER REAL POVERTY IN BRITAIN, THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY HAS BEEN EVENKINDER TO THE NEW-RICH . IT IS AT THIS LEVEL THAT LIFE IN BRITAIN OFTENSEEMS TASTELESS, AIMLESS AND IMMORAL . A NEW TWIST TO A VICTORIAN MUSICHALL BALLAD " IT'S THE RICH WOT GETS THE PLEASHOOR, IT'S THE POOR WOTGETS THE BLYME " WAS ADDED RECENTLY BY MINISTER OF HOUSING SIR KEITHJOSEPH, WHO SAID EARNESTLY : " IT IS HARDER FOR THE RICH OR THERELATIVELY SECURE TO BE PURE . " AND YET TOO MUCH CAN BE BLAMED ONECONOMIC FACTORS, LEADING TO WHAT THE ECONOMIST CALLS " THE UNTENABLEIMPLICATION THAT ADULTERY WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS RAMPANT IF ONLY THECOUNTRY HAD BEEN DECENT ENOUGH TO STAY POOR . " DECENCY IS OFTEN AQUESTION OF STYLE . MANY BRITONS FEEL THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG, ORAT LEAST NEW, IN A CABINET MINISTER HAVING A MISTRESS . BUT THERE IS ASLIGHTLY SNOBBISH FEELING THAT CHRISTINE KEELER AND HER SET REALLY WEREA BIT TOO CASUAL . ALTHOUGH IN BRITAIN THE OFFICIAL MISTRESS HAS NEVERQUITE REACHED THE GLITTERING STATUS SHE HAS IN FRANCE, THE GREAT ANDSMALL AFFAIRS OF THE PAST WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE QUIET, SETTLED,NEAR-PERMANENT ARRANGEMENTS . A NEW FACTOR, SAYS DAILY MAIL COLUMNISTANNE SCOTT-JAMES, IS THE " SLEAZINESS OF THE CROWD WITH WHICH THE WARMINISTER MIXED . " SAYS MUGGERIDGE : " FIFTY YEARS AGO PEOPLE WOULDHAVE GONE TO MAIDA VALE AND PATRONIZED ONE OF THE GRANDES COCOTTES . IFTHERE IS ANYTHING NEW IN THIS, IT IS THE OVERLAPPING OF THE SOCIAL LIFEOF CLIVEDEN AND OF WARD . " IN SHORT, BRITAIN MAY BE IN DANGER OFABANDONING ACTRESS MRS .
