THE HOLE IN THE WALL THE SWEETEST CHRISTMASMUSIC BERLINERS HAVE HEARD IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD NOTHING TO DOWITH BACH OR HANDEL . IT WAS THE UGLY STUTTER OF JACKHAMMERS TEARINGGATES IN THE BERLIN WALL, THE WHINE OF CRANES REMOVING ZIGZAG BARRIERSFROM HEAVILY GUARDED CROSSING POINTS . THEN, LATE LAST WEEK, THECANDYSTRIPE CUSTOMS POLES WENT UP, AND THOUSANDS OF GRINNING,GIFT-LADEN WEST BERLINERS SWARMED THROUGH THE WALL FOR THEIR FIRSTREUNIONS WITH EASTERN SECTOR RELATIVES SINCE AUGUST 1961 . A LONG ROWOF GLOWING CHARCOAL BRAZIERS WARMED THE APPROACH TO THE OBERBAUMBRIDGE, AND TWO BRIGHTLY LIT CHRISTMAS TREES GUARDED ITS WESTERN END .ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER SPREE, EVEN THE TRIGGER-HAPPY EASTGERMAN VOPOS WORE GRINS ABOVE THEIR CRADLED SUBMACHINE GUNS . ONLY TILLMIDNIGHT . IRONICALLY, COMMUNISM'S GRUDGING CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO WESTBERLIN SEEMS TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN THE TOY FACTORY OF NIKITAKHRUSHCHEV, WHO RESEMBLES SANTA CLAUS ONLY IN SHAPE . CHILLED BY THERECEPTION EAST GERMANS GAVE HIM LAST SUMMER AT THE WALL, AND AWARE THATTHE SPIRIT OF DETENTE HAD NOT YET THAWED THE FROZEN PIVOTAL POINT INEAST-WEST RELATIONS, KHRUSHCHEV TALKED EAST GERMAN BOSS WALTER ULBRICHTINTO OPENING NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CHRISTMAS VISITS . ULBRICHT WASAPPARENTLY IN NO MOOD TO BE GENEROUS . THE HOLE IN THE WALL IS A TINYONE BY ANY MEASUREMENT . ONLY THOSE WEST BERLINERS WHO HAVE IMMEDIATERELATIVES IN THE COMMUNIST PART OF THE CITY MAY PASS THROUGH THE FIVESPECIAL ENTRY POINTS DESIGNATED BY THE EAST GERMANS . PASSES, ISSUED BYEAST GERMAN POSTAL OFFICIALS, ARE GOOD THROUGH JAN . 5, BUT ONLY FROM 7A.M . TO MIDNIGHT, EXCEPT ON NEW YEAR'S DAY WHEN THE PASS HOLDERS MAYSTAGGER BACK AS LATE AS 5 A.M . THOUGH SOME 800,000 WEST BERLINERSQUALIFY FOR THE PASSES, MANY OF THEM ARE FLUCHTLINGE REFUGEES FROM EASTGERMANY WHO WOULD BE NABBED BY THE VOPOS THE MOMENT THEY CROSSED THEWALL AND THEREFORE WILL NOT DARE TO TRY IT . TEARS & BRANDY . BUTDESPITE RESTRICTIONS AND RED TAPE, SOME HALF A MILLION WEST BERLINERSWILL PROBABLY MAKE THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY BEFORE THE HOLIDAY SEASONENDS MANY OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE . TEARS AND BRANDY FLOWED AS THE FIRSTVISITORS CROSSED THE WALL . GRANDPARENTS SIZED UP SNOW-SUITEDTWO-YEAR-OLDS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN EXCEPT IN PHOTOGRAPHS . " DOES THEBABY MEET THE FAMILY STANDARDS ? " ASKED ONE PROUD WEST GERMAN MOTHER. " JA, SCHON, " WEPT THE GRANDMOTHER . ALTHOUGH THE WEST BERLINERSARRIVED LADEN WITH EVERYTHING FROM LEBKUCHEN TO LONG UNDERWEAR, NOT ALLTHE GIFTS CAME FROM THEIR SIDE OF THE WALL . ONE EAST GERMAN LAD BLEW AYEAR'S SAVINGS ON TWO GEESE, A SWEATER AND A BOTTLE OF BRANDY TOWELCOME HIS LONG-IMMURED RELATIVES . SOME WESTERN DIPLOMATS FELT THECOMMUNIST CHRISTMAS PRESENT WAS WRAPPED IN BLACKMAIL, NERVOUSLY AWAITEDULBRICHT'S NEXT MOVE . BUT THOUGH THE HOLE IN THE WALL WILL BE SEALEDUP AFTER THE HOLIDAY SEASON, IT WILL NEVER SEEM SO IMPENETRABLE AGAIN .AFTER THIS BRIEF, TANTALIZING BREACH, THE WALL'S UGLY MASONRY WILL LOOKALL THE MORE INTOLERABLE TO EAST AND WEST BERLINER ALIKE .
