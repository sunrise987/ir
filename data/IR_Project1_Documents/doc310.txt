DEFENDANT MARTELLIREADILY ADMITTED MOST OF THE CROWN'S CHARGES, BUT EXPLAINED THAT HE HADMERELY BEEN STRINGING OUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REDS IN ORDER TODENOUNCE THEM AT THE RIGHT MOMENT TO BRITISH AUTHORITIES . AFTERDELIBERATING FOR NINE HOURS AND 47 MINUTES, THE JURORS DECIDED TOBELIEVE MARTELLI AND DECLARED HIM NOT GUILTY . IN BOTH LONDON ANDMOSCOW, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT SOVIETOFFICIAL WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST 18 MONTHS AGO, WAS THOROUGHLYINTERROGATED IN THE U.S., AND IS NOW A RESIDENT OF BRITAIN . THE MAN'SNAME WAS GIVEN AS ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN, AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ALERTLYNOTED THAT A DIPLOMAT OF THE SAME NAME HAD SERVED FOR NINE MONTHS INTHE SOVIET EMBASSY IN LONDON . MOSCOW'S IZVESTIA THEN GOT INTO THE ACT,INSISTING THAT, FAR FROM DEFECTING, DOLNYTSIN HAD LEFT HIS LONDON POSTIN 1961 AND HAD BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY INMOSCOW (TO PROVE ITS POINT, IZVESTIA EVEN PUBLISHED HIS PICTURE) .QUESTIONS RAISED IN BRITAIN'S HOUSE OF COMMONS GOT ONLY ANACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT SOMEBODY DID DEFECT FROM RUSSIA 18 MONTHS AGO ANDHAD BEEN GIVEN ASYLUM IN BRITAIN . POSSIBLY, THERE HAD BEEN TWO RUSSIANOFFICIALS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES . NOW WILL THE REAL ANATOLYDOLNYTSIN PLEASE STAND UP ?
