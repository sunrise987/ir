NIGERIA NATION ON TRIAL IN 1960, WHEN NIGERIA WON ITSINDEPENDENCE, IT BECAME AT BIRTH THE WORLD'S MOST POPULOUS BLACK STATEAND AFRICA'S BIGGEST QUESTION MARK . HELD TOGETHER IN UNEASYFEDERATION, THE COUNTRY NUMBERED SOME 250 TRIBES AND LANGUAGES, THREEPRINCIPAL RELIGIONS (MOSLEM, CHRISTIAN, ANIMIST), AND THREE BIG,TRADITIONALLY HOSTILE REGIONS : THE FEUDAL, MOSLEM NORTH, WHICH CLAIMSHALF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF NIGERIA ; THE EAST, DOMINATED BY THEASTUTE, INDUSTRIOUS IBO TRIBES ; AND THE WEST, RICHEST AND MOSTADVANCED OF ALL THREE, WHOSE YORUBA TRIBESMEN ARE NIGERIA'S MOSTSOPHISTICATED CITIZENS . AS BIG AS TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA COMBINED, WITHSOME 45 MILLION INHABITANTS GIVE OR TAKE 10 MILLION NIGERIA SEEMED LESSA NATION THAN A CONCATENATION, A HAPHAZARD CREATION OF BRITISHCOLONISTS WHO RULED IT FOR 60 YEARS AND DUBBED IT THE " WHITE MAN'SGRAVE . " NIGERIA HAS SURVIVED TO BECOME AFRICA'S MOST CONSPICUOUSLYSUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY . ITS BIRTH PANGS WERE EASED BY A LONG TRADITIONOF TRIBAL GOVERNMENT, AND BY THE SOLID GOOD SENSE OF MANY AFRICANLEADERS WHOM THE BRITISH GROOMED FOR SELF-RULE NOTABLY ITS FEDERALPRIME MINISTER, SIR ABUBAKAR TAFAWA BALEWA (TIME COVER, DEC . 5, 1960). THE GREATEST SINGLE ASSURANCE OF STABILITY HAS BEEN NIGERIA'S TRIPODFORM OF GOVERNMENT, DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY ONE REGION FROM DOMINATINGTHE OTHER TWO . THAT SYSTEM IS NOW IN JEOPARDY, AND WITH IT THE VERYFUTURE OF NIGERIA AS A DEMOCRACY AND AS A NATION . POLITICAL PLAY ?NIGERIA'S COMPLEX CRISIS IS BEING PLAYED OUT IN THE SCRUPULOUSLYDECOROUS HIGH COURT IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL OF LAGOS . THERE, IN THECOURSE OF A TRIAL THAT HAS DRAGGED ON FOR FOUR MONTHS, THE LEADER OFTHE OPPOSITION, OBAFEMI AWOLOWO, LAST WEEK OPENED HIS OWN DEFENSEAGAINST A GOVERNMENT INDICTMENT CHARGING HIM AND 24 OTHER LEADINGPOLITICIANS WITH CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT . NEARLY ALLTHE DEFENDANTS ARE MEMBERS OF AWOLOWO'S ACTION GROUP, THE PARTY THATRULES WESTERN NIGERIA AND REPRESENTS IT IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT .CHIEF AWOLOWO IS NOT ALONE IN BRANDING THE TRIAL A POLITICAL PLAY TOWRECK HIS PARTY AND ELIMINATE THE OPPOSITION . THE CRISIS WAS ACTUALLYPRECIPITATED BY AWOLOWO, 54, A MERCURIAL, LONDON-TRAINED BARRISTER WHOBECAME OPPOSITION LEADER IN LAGOS WHEN HIS PARTY LOST THE 1959 FEDERALELECTIONS . AWOLOWO THEN RANGED HIS PEOPLE FIRMLY AGAINST THEMIDDLE-ROAD COALITION GOVERNMENT, COMPOSED OF THE CONSERVATIVE NORTHERNPEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC), SUPPORTED BY THE PROUD, PRIMITIVE FULANI ANDHAUSA TRIBES OF THE NORTH, AND THE PROGRESSIVE NATIONAL CONVENTION OFNIGERIAN CITIZENS (NCNC), WHICH IS BASED IN THE EAST . SMASHED MACE .CHIEF SAMUEL L . AKINTOLA, WHO BECAME DEPUTY LEADER OF THE ACTION GROUPAND WESTERN REGION PREMIER, LAST MAY REBELLED AGAINST AWOLOWO'SPOLICIES, WAS SACKED AS DEPUTY LEADER AND DISMISSED AS THE WEST'SPREMIER (HE WAS LATER REINSTATED BY COURT ORDER) . AWOLOWO'SHIGH-HANDED REPRISALS LED TO A CHAIRTHROWING MELEE IN THE WESTERNREGION ASSEMBLY AT IBADAN IN WHICH THE CEREMONIAL MACE WAS SHATTEREDAND THE POLITICIANS SUBDUED WITH TEAR GAS . SEIZING THEIR CHANCE TOQUASH THE OPPOSITION, RIVAL PARTY BOSSES IN LAGOS PERSUADED THERELUCTANT SIR ABUBAKAR TO DISPATCH FEDERAL FORCES TO THE WEST ANDDECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT WAS LIFTED ONLY AT YEAR'S END . THEGOVERNMENT ALSO INITIATED AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION OF REGIONAL ANDPARTY FINANCES, CHARGED AWOLOWO AND OTHER PARTY CHIEFTAINS WITHDIVERTING $18 MILLION IN PUBLIC FUNDS . ON TOP OF THE CORRUPTIONSCANDALS, THE GOVERNMENT LAST NOVEMBER FILED ITS SENSATIONAL INDICTMENTACCUSING AWOLOWO OF SENDING AGENTS TO GHANA FOR PARA-MILITARY TRAININGAS TERRORISTS IN A PLOT TO SEIZE POWER IN LAGOS . UNIVERSAL DASH .CHIEF AWOLOWO LAST WEEK SCORNFULLY TERMED " ABSOLUTELY UNRELIABLE ANDINCREDIBLE " THE PROSECUTION'S CHARGES THAT HE HAD CONSPIRED TO " LEVYWAR " AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . " TODAY, " HE SAID DEFIANTLY, " I MAY BELANGUISHING IN PRISON . I AM NOT GOING TO DIE THERE . I STILL BELIEVE IWILL BE PRIME MINISTER SOME DAY . /AS FOR THE CORRUPTION CHARGES, AWOLOWO'SSUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT MALFEASANCE IS NO LESS RIFE IN THE OTHER REGIONS. THEY ARE PROBABLY QUITE RIGHT . " DASH, " AS NIGERIANS CHEERFULLYCALL THEIR RITUALISTIC SYSTEM OF PAYOFFS, IS SO UNIVERSAL THAT MANYTRAFFIC COPS HAVE A FIXED BRIBE FOR EVERY VIOLATION (RUNNING A REDLIGHT COSTS 28 #$ ), AND HOSPITAL NURSES SOMETIMES DEMAND A PENNY FORBRINGING A PATIENT A BEDPAN . MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, WHOSE CADILLACSAND MERCEDESES HELP MAKE LAGOS TRAFFIC JAMS AMONG THE WORST IN AFRICA,EARN MORE ($17,000 INCLUDING EXPENSES) THAN BRITISH M.P.S, BUT MANYMANAGE TO EKE OUT THE COST OF LIVING ON IKOYI ISLAND WITH A LITTLE HELPFROM FOREIGN INDUSTRIALISTS AND LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS . " NIGERIANBUSINESSMEN, " SAYS A EUROPEAN BANKER IN LAGOS, " ARE THE BIGGEST BUNCHOF CON MEN I'VE EVER SEEN . " FOR ALL THEIR SURFACE CYNICISM, NIGERIANSBY CONTRAST WITH MOST THIN-SKINNED CITIZENS OF AFRICA'S NEW NATIONS ARESEARCHINGLY SELF-CRITICAL AND TAKE FIERCE PRIDE IN THEIR EXUBERANTLYUNINHIBITED PRESS . YOUNGER POLITICIANS IN ALL THE PARTIES AREINCREASINGLY DISILLUSIONED BY THE FLAGRANT VENALITY OF THEIR ELDERS ANDTHE CHASM THAT DIVIDES LAGOS' DOYENS OF DASH FROM THE JOBLESS HORDESWHO HAVE SWARMED INTO ITS FESTERING SLUMS AND ALMOST TREBLED THE CITY'SPOPULATION (TO 750,000) IN THREE DECADES . THE BEST GUARANTEE . MANYYOUNG NIGERIANS DERIDE THE GOVERNMENT'S FAITH IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE,AND IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS THEY ARE OPENLY IMPATIENT WITH THEINCORRUPTIBLE SIR ABUBAKAR'S PRAGMATIC, UNPRETENTIOUS AND RATHEROLD-FASHIONED STYLE . AS AFRICA'S MOST POPULOUS NATION, THEY ARGUE,NIGERIA IS THE CONTINENT'S LOGICAL LEADER . " WHEN YOU'RE IN ACCRA, "COMPLAINS A LAGOS NEWSMAN, " YOU CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT YOU'RE AT THECENTER OF PAN-AFRICAN ACTIVITY . WHY DON'T WE GET REFUGEES FROM OTHERPARTS OF AFRICA ? " IF THE ACTION GROUP IS DESTROYED BY THE TREASONTRIAL, MANY NIGERIANS BELIEVE, A NEW, RADICAL PARTY WILL HAVE TO TAKEITS PLACE OR ELSE THE NATION'S RESTIVE LEFTWINGERS MAY WELL RESORT TOREAL VIOLENCE . MEANWHILE, THOUGH PREMIER AKINTOLA HAS ALREADY FORMED ANEW,MODERATE MOVEMENT IN THE WEST CALLED THE UNITED PEOPLE'S PARTY, THEVACUUM LEFT BY THE ACTION GROUP MAY BE FILLED BY THE NCNC, WHOSELONGTIME BOSS, DR . NNAMDI ( " ZIK " ) AZIKIWE, IS MORE OR LESS REMOVEDFROM ACTIVE POLITICS IN HIS POST AS NIGERIA'S GOVERNOR-GENERAL . BUTAMBITIOUS, FLAMBOYANT ZIK MAKES NO SECRET OF HIS AIM TO MAKE NIGERIA AREPUBLIC, IN WHICH NCNC COULD EMERGE AS THE DOMINANT NATIONAL PARTY ANDZIK HIMSELF MIGHT WELL BE A STRONG PRESIDENT.MANY NIGERIANS, SHOCKED BYTHE GOVERNMENT'S SEVEN-MONTH SUSPENSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, NOW FEAR THATA SINGLE, POWERFUL PARTY MAY BE TEMPTED TO IMPOSE THE KIND OFAUTHORITARIAN RULE THAT HAS BEEN RIVETED ON GHANA AND GUINEA . THEGOVERNMENT'S MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS THAT THE COUNTRY'S CURRENTSCANDALS WILL MAR ITS REPUTATION FOR STABILITY AND SCARE AWAY THEFOREIGN INVESTORS ON WHOM IT IS COUNTING FOR AT LEAST 50 PER CENT OFTHE FINANCING FOR THE $1.9 BILLION, SIX-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN ITLAUNCHED LAST YEAR . TO SIR ABUBAKAR, THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESSTHIS WILL ENSURE IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF MEANINGFUL NATIONHOOD FORNIGERIA .
