THEY'RE OFF ONLY SIX WEEKS AGO, MOST BRITISH POLITICIANSBELIEVED THAT PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN'S GOVERNMENT WOULD NOTDARE CALL A GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE SPRING 1964 . BUT IN WESTMINSTERLAST WEEK M.P.S WERE WAGERING THAT THE TORIES WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLETHIS FALL . LABOR PARTY LEADERS EVEN CLAIMED TO KNOW THE DATE : OCT .24, ABOUT THE LAST POSSIBLE THURSDAY (BRITAIN'S TRADITIONAL POLLINGDAY) BEFORE THE END OF CAMPAIGNING SEASON . REASON FOR THE SHIFT INTHINKING WAS THE GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT CAME WITHSPRING'S THAW AFTER THE WORST WINTER OF THE CENTURY . SUDDENLY CAMEWORD OF NEW EXPORT RECORDS, BOOMING RETAIL SALES AND SWELLING COMPANYPROFITS . MOST WELCOME NEWS OF ALL LAST WEEK WAS THAT THE REMORSELESSFIVE-MONTH RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT HAD FINALLY DRIFTED DOWN TO 604,000,OFF NEARLY 100,000 FROM THE MARCH FIGURE . PROMISES & THREATS . THETORIES STILL FACED A LONG, HAZARDOUS HAUL . POLITICALLY ANDECONOMICALLY, THE BIGGEST ROADBLOCK IS THAT INDUSTRY WILL NOT BE ABLETO EXPAND AND COMPETE IN WORLD MARKETS WITHOUT VIGOROUS, UNPOPULARMEASURES TO HOLD WAGE BOOSTS TO HALF THEIR RATE OF INCREASE OVER THEPAST DECADE . ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT, BY FALL,CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING'S CANNY BUDGET (TIME,APRIL 12) WILL HAVE BOOSTED PRODUCTION, WHITTLED UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUTEXTRA SPENDING MONEY IN LOWER-INCOME POCKETS . IN FACT, MANY TORY M.P.SNOW FEAR THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT WAITS UNTIL NEXT YEAR BEFORE CALLINGTHE ELECTION, IT MAY LOSE ITS GAINS IN ANOTHER WINTER SLUMP AND HAVEEVEN LESS TIME FOR RECOVERY BEFORE ITS FIVEYEAR MANDATE EXPIRES INOCTOBER 1964 . IN ANY CASE, THE CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY UNDER WAY . PRIMEMINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN THREW A STRAW IN THE WIND BY REAPPOINTINGHARDHEADED LORD POOLE AS COCHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY WITH LEADER OF THEHOUSE IAIN MACLEOD . POOLE, WHO RAISED RECORD SUMS FOR THE TORIES INTHE 1955 AND 1959 CAMPAIGNS, IS THE REPUTED AUTHOR OF THE "NEVER-HAD-IT-SO-GOOD " THEME THAT HELPED RETURN THE GOVERNMENT AT THELAST ELECTION . GREY UTOPIA . LAST WEEKEND, WITH POOLE AND 32 OTHER TOPTORIES WHO WERE SUMMONED TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S COUNTRY HOME,MACMILLAN STARTED DRAFTING THE PARTY'S BROAD, LONG-TERM PROGRAM OFSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM . ITS THEME, SAID MACMILLAN, WILL BE "MODERNIZE NOT NATIONALIZE . " IN HIS FIERCEST ATTACK ON LABOR IN MANYMONTHS, THE PRIME MINISTER CHARGED IN A SPEECH TO GLASGOW TORIES THAT "THE SOCIALISTS HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER EXCEPT OLD THREATS SUPPORTED BYSLY PROMISES . " THE OPPOSITION, DECLARED MACMILLAN, STILL CLINGS TOITS " OLD-HAT " VIEW OF A SOCIALIST UTOPIA, IN WHICH " EVERYBODY ISMORE OR LESS THE SAME SHADE OF GREY . " HE INSISTED THAT UNDER LABOR,BRITAIN WOULD REVERT SWIFTLY TO THE STATUS OF A " SECONDCLASS POWER . "MACMILLAN'S FINAL DECISION ON THE ELECTION DATE WILL BE INFLUENCED BYTHE GALLUP POLL PERCENTAGES, WHICH IN APRIL SHOWED A FRACTIONAL SLIP INLABOR'S MASSIVE LEAD, NOW 49.5 PER CENT TO 34 PER CENT , OVER THETORIES . OTHER OMENS WILL BE THE RESULTS OF THREE SPRING BY-ELECTIONSNECESSITATED BY THE DEATHS OF HUGH GAITSKELL AND TWO OTHER LABOR M.P.S. ONE THING WAS CERTAIN : AT 69, HAROLD MACMILLAN IS STILL CONFIDENTTHAT THE PARTY CANNOT YET DISPENSE WITH HIS LEADERSHIP . BY WAY OFPATCHING PARTY MORALE, HE HAS ALREADY QUASHED BACK-BENCH RUMORS THAT HEMIGHT STEP DOWN . " I'LL BE LEADING YOU INTO THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION,/ HE TOLD TORY M.P.S RECENTLY, " AND I'LL BE WITH YOU IN THE NEWPARLIAMENT . /
