ITALY SEARCH FOR THE FEASIBLE IN ROME'S HANDSOME,HALF-MOON-SHAPED CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES LAST WEEK, EVERYONE HAD TO MOVELITERALLY TO THE RIGHT TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE 166 NEWLY ELECTEDCOMMUNISTS, A 20 PER CENT INCREASE OVER THEIR PREVIOUS SHOWING .THE REDS PROMPTLY MADE THEIR POWER FELT IN THE BALLOTING FOR PRESIDINGOFFICERS : FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, A WOMAN, MARIA LISA RODANO,42, WAS ELECTED CHAMBER VICE PRESIDENT . SHE IS A COMMUNIST WHO INSISTSSHE IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC AS WELL AND ATTENDS MASS ON SUNDAYS . RED BOSSPALMIRO TOGLIATTI'S COCKY DEMAND THAT COMMUNISTS BE ADMITTED TO THEGOVERNMENT WAS COLDLY REFUSED . ONLY SOLUTION . RED JUBILANCE WASMATCHED BY CONTINUED DISSENSION IN THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY .FOCUS OF BLAME FOR THE PARTY'S 4 PER CENT DROP IN VOTES ISPREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI . HARDFISTED DEPUTY MARIO SCELBA DECLARED REDSUCCESS " IS THE FRUIT OF OUR MISTAKES AND NOT OF THE SUPERIORITY OFCOMMUNIST IDEALS . " SCELBA AND OTHERS OF THE CENTER AND RIGHT STRONGLYOPPOSE A CONTINUANCE OF THE APERTURA A SINISTRA, THE SO-CALLED OPENINGTO THE LEFT, INITIATED LAST YEAR BY FANFANI WHEN HE FORMED HIS ALLIANCEWITH PIETRO NENNI'S SOCIALISTS . TROUBLE IS, NO OTHER ALLIANCE SEEMSFEASIBLE . FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, A COALITION WITH THE RIGHTWINGMONARCHISTS AND NEO-FASCISTS IS UNTHINKABLE . " GIVEN THE PARLIAMENTARYSITUATION AND THE PREVALENT TRENDS AMONG THE PARTY, ENTED MILAN'SCORRIERE DELLA SERA, " NO SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE OTHER THAN THE SO-CALLEDCENTER LEFT . " WHAT SEEMS LESS CERTAIN IS THAT PINTSIZED, PEPPERYAMINTORE FANFANI WILL SURVIVE AS PREMIER . IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITALIANPROCEDURE, FANFANI LAST WEEK HANDED HIS RESIGNATION TO PRESIDENTANTONIO SEGNI, WHO IS EXPECTED TO NAME A PREMIER-DESIGNATE THIS WEEKNFANI IS PASSED OVER, NO . 1 CANDIDATE FOR THE OFFICE WILL BE THECHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' TALL, UNASSUMING ALDO MORO, 46, WHO BECAME INTERIMPARTY LEADER IN 1959 AND HAS SINCE EMERGED AS PARTY STRONGMAN . ONLY ACARETAKER . MORO IS SAID TO BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE JOB, AND HISLAVISH PRAISE FOR FANFANI AT THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COUNCIL MEETING LASTWEEK SUGGESTED THAT HE, FOR ONE, WOULD PRESS FOR LITTLE AMINTORE'SCONTINUANCE IN OFFICE . IN ANY CASE, HE WOULD NOT LIKELY CHANGEFANFANI'S POLICIES, SINCE HE HIMSELF WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THEAPERTURA A SINISTRA AND FORCED PARTY ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN WITH ASIX-HOUR SPEECH AT LAST YEAR'S NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE CHRISTIANDEMOCRATS IN NAPLES . BUT MORO IS SOMEWHAT LESS ENTHUSIASTIC THANFANFANI ABOUT ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE MOREOUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE NEED TO CHECK THE COMMUNISTS . MOREOVER, HE MIGHTBE A LOT MORE POPULAR . WHERE FANFANI ENJOYS SHARP EXCHANGES AND ISQUICK TO TRADE INSULTS, MORO IS RESERVED, ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANGRYDEBATES WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AND DETESTS NAME CALLING . SAYS ONE OF HISFRIENDS, ADMIRINGLY, " MORO RUNS THE PARTY THE WAY HE DRIVES A CAR . HEKEEPS BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL AND BOTH EYES ON THE ROAD, AND HE NEVERDRIVES MORE THAN 35 MILES AN HOUR . " WHETHER SEGNI CHOOSES MORO ORSTICKS WITH FANFANI, THE PREMIERSHIP WILL PROBABLY BE NO MORE THAN ACARETAKER'S POSITION FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS . FOR NOT UNTIL MID-JULYWILL NENNI'S SOCIALISTS HOLD THEIR ANNUAL CONVENTION AND DECIDE WHETHEROR NOT TO STICK WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AND KEEP THE CENTER-LEFTALLIANCE ALIVE .
