ACROSS THE ROAD LAY ANOTHERBARRACKS, HOUSING THE 317TH SUPPLY SQUADRON, WHERE THE AIRMEN WEREWINDING UP A " G.I . PARTY, " THAT IS, A CLEANUP BEFORE NEXT MORNING'SINSPECTION . DEATH AT DAWN . THE NEGROES PASSING BY WERE NOISY, ANDSOMEONE SHOUTED AT THEM FROM A SECOND-STORY WINDOW OF THE SUPPLYSQUADRON BARRACKS . NO ONE KNOWS WHO DID THE SHOUTING . NO ONE AGREESON WHAT WAS SHOUTED . BUT UNQUESTIONABLY, THE SHOUTS CONTAINED WHATNEGRO SOLDIERS AT EVREUX CALL " THE MAGIC WORD " NIGGER . RUSHING INTOTHEIR OWN BARRACKS, THE NEGROES GRABBED 12IN . METAL RODS USED TOTRANSFORM BEDS INTO BUNKS AND RACED ACROSS THE STREET . FIRST THERE WASMUCH PUSHING, SHOUTING AND LOUD ARGUMENT . THEN A FIGHT BROKE OUT,LASTING APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS . WHEN IT WAS OVER, SIX WHITE AIRMENWERE HOSPITALIZED WITH HEAD WOUNDS . NONE OF THE INJURIES SEEMEDSERIOUS, BUT AT DAWN AIRMAN FIRST CLASS ROBERT PADGETT, 23, OFWOODLAWN, VA., DIED OF A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE .

THE QUARTERMASTERCOMPANY, THE ONLY ARMY UNIT ON THE BASE, MUST SUBMIT TO A MIDNIGHT BEDCHECK, WHILE AIRMEN HAVE ONLY TO REPORT FOR DUTY EACH MORNING . AS ANAIRBORNE UNIT, THE QUARTERMASTER COMPANY KEEPS IN RUGGED PHYSICALSHAPE, HAS THE TOUGH LOOK OF GUNG-HO SOLDIERS . THE MEN OF THE SUPPLYUNIT HAVE THE LOOK OF OFFICE WORKERS AND THE VANITY OF INTELLECTUALS .ONE AIRMAN SNEERED, " YOU COULD TAKE THAT WHOLE ARMY COMPANY ACROSS THEROAD AND ADD UP THEIR IQS AND YOU WOULDN'T GET 200 . " AT WEEK'S ENDEVEN MORE DOUBT WAS CAST ON THE RACIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE FIGHT WHEN ASIXTH MEMBER OF THE QUARTERMASTER COMPANY WAS ARRESTED AND ALSO CHARGEDWITH HOMICIDE AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT .
