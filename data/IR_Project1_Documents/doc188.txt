MIDDLE EAST SHEIK JACKPOT FIVE TIMES A DAY FOR THE PAST 30YEARS, THIN, THREADBARE SHEIK SHAKHBUT BIN SULTAN FACED WEST, BOWEDLOW, AND PRAYED FOR AN OIL STRIKE . HIS REALM OF ABU DHABI WASDESPERATELY IN NEED OF SOME GOOD LUCK . UP AND DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF,THE STATES OF QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND IRAN WERE ROLLING IN OILWEALTH . BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, ABU DHABI'S 25,000 SQ . MI . OF SAND,DATE PALMS AND BARREN OFFSHORE ISLANDS JUST GOT HOTTER, MORE HUMID ANDWINDSWEPT THAN BEFORE . PERPETUAL TRUCE . BUT THEN ALLAH RESPONDED TOTHE SHEIK'S PRAYERS BELATEDLY, BUT IN OVERWHELMING MEASURE . TWO VASTOILFIELDS HAVE BEEN TAPPED BY BRITISH DRILLING TEAMS, ONE AT MURBAN INTHE SANDY INTERIOR, THE OTHER IN THE SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS OF THE GULF. CONSERVATIVE OILMEN ESTIMATE ABU DHABI'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES AT ABOUT3.8 BILLION BBL., WHICH AT PRESENT ROYALTY RATES WOULD RETURN SOME $1.4BILLION OVER THE YEARS . RIDICULOUS, SAY OTHER EXPERTS : ON THE BASISOF LATEST DISCOVERIES, RESERVES MAY BE AS GREAT AS 38 BILLION BBL .THIS HAS ALL BEEN RATHER UNSETTLING TO ABU DHABI, WHOSE 15,000 BEDOUINSHAVE GOT ALONG FOR CENTURIES ON PIRACY, PEARL FISHING AND INTERTRIBALRAIDS . IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE SWIFT PIRATE DHOWS WERE SWEPT FROM THEGULF BY BRITAIN, WHICH ESTABLISHED " A PERPETUAL MARITIME TRUCE " HENCETHE NAME TRUCIAL STATES, GIVEN TO ABU DHABI AND SIX OTHER SHEIKDOMS .PEARL FISHING BECAME UNPROFITABLE WHEN THE JAPANESE CLEVERLY INTRODUCEDCULTURED PEARLS TO THE WORLD . THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO ABU DHABI BUTINTRIGUE : OF THE TWELVE PREDECESSORS OF THE PRESENT SHEIK, ONLY THREEDIED PEACEFULLY IN THEIR PALACE BEDS . THE REST WERE EITHER MURDERED ORVIOLENTLY DEPOSED, USUALLY BY CLOSE RELATIVES . SHEIK SHAKHBUT TOOKOVER IN 1928 WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS ASSASSINATED, AFTER HAVING EARLIERKILLED SHAKHBUT'S FATHER WHO, IN TURN, HAD COME TO POWER BY KILLING HISOLDER BROTHER . SHAKHBUT IS SAID TO HAVE RULED SO LONG AND SAFELY ONLYBECAUSE HIS OWN TWO BROTHERS SWORE A SOLEMN OATH ON THE KORAN NOT TOMURDER HIM . BUGS IN THE TREASURY . IN HIS LONG YEARS OF OIL-LESS RULE,SHEIK SHAKHBUT RAN HIS COUNTRY ON CUSTOMS DUTIES OF $140,000 A YEAR,FOUGHT SOME DESULTORY WARS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS IN SHARJA AND DUBAI, ANDLIVED QUIETLY IN HIS MUD-WALLED PALACE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND . HEINSTALLED AN AIR CONDITIONER IN HIS BEDROOM BUT SELDOM USED IT BECAUSEHE DISLIKED THE NOISE . HE ALSO PUT IN A FLUSH TOILET AND A PUMP TOSUPPLY IT WITH WATER ; SEWAGE DISPOSAL WAS SIMPLY A PIPE JUTTING OUTFROM THE PALACE WALL . NEARLY EVERY DAY, THE SHEIK SAT CROSSLEGGED INHIS THRONE ROOM HOLDING A MAJLIS, AT WHICH HE LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS OFCITIZENS, WHILE BEDOUIN CHIEFS GROUPED AROUND HIM, SOME HOLDING ONTHEIR WRISTS THE HOODED FALCONS THAT WERE ABU DHABI'S ONLY STATUSSYMBOL . WHEN THE OIL REVENUES BEGAN TO FLOW IN LAST YEAR, EVERYONEEXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF SHEIK SHAKHBUT . BUT IT SOON DEVELOPED THATWHAT SHAKHBUT LIKED TO DO WITH MONEY WAS COUNT IT, NOT SPEND IT . HEREFUSED TO ACCEPT CHECKS FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, AT FIRST KEPT HIS CASHUNDER HIS BED . WHEN THE BEDSPRINGS BEGAN TO BULGE, HE HAD THE CASHCARTED TO A PALACE DUNGEON . IT WAS ONLY AFTER RATS BEGAN NIBBLING ATTHE TREASURE CHESTS AND INSECTS STARTED EATING THE FOLDING MONEY THATSHAKHBUT RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF BANKING . HE NOWFLOURISHES AN OUTSIZE CHECKBOOK, EMBLAZONED WITH THE RED AND WHITE FLAGOF ABU DHABI, BUT HE STILL HATES TO SIGN CHECKS . PUTTING OFF PAYDAY .BRITAIN, WHICH HAS A MOTHER-HEN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ALLEGEDLYINDEPENDENT TRUCIAL STATES, LAST YEAR PROMOTED AN ABU DHABI DEVELOPMENTPROGRAM CALLING FOR $70 MILLION WORTH OF ROADS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLICWORKS . SHEIK SHAKHBUT, 58, ACCEPTED THE PLAN ONLY INTHEORY.BUSINESSMEN DEALING WITH THE SHEIK HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERNIGHTGREY HAIR . " HE SIMPLY ASKS FOR 50 PER CENT IN EVERY BUSINESS DEAL !/ SPUTTERED A LEVANTINE ENTREPRENEUR . SHAKHBUT MAY AMIABLY CONCEDETHAT HE HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WORK TO BE DONE, THEN ADDS CAGILY, "BUT I DIDN'T SAY I WOULD PAY FOR IT . " HIS PENNY PINCHING EVEN EXTENDSTO ABU DHABI'S 470-MAN ARMY : EACH SOLDIER IS PAID PERSONALLY BYSHAKHBUT, WHO STALLS OFF PAYDAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . THE SHEIK'S MINDRESEMBLES A REVOLVING DOOR . SINCE ABU DHABI HAS VIRTUALLY NO WATER (AGLASS OF WATER COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS A GLASS OF GIN), THERE IS ADESPERATE NEED FOR MODERN EQUIPMENT TO DISTILL SEA WATER . BUT THESHEIK HAS THREE TIMES SHIFTED THE LOCATION OF A PROPOSED NEWDISTILLATION PLANT AND MAY WELL SHIFT IT THREE OR 30 TIMES MORE .GROANED A FRUSTRATED BRITISH ENGINEER : " WE FREQUENTLY DO SIX WEEKS'WORK FOR NOTHING . " THE BRITISH PRODUCED PLANS TO MAKE ABU DHABI CITYINTO A GLITTERING MODERN CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE THE PRIDE OF THE PERSIANGULF, BUT AS FAST AS ENGINEERS LAY OUT A NEW BOULEVARD, SHAKHBUT GRANTSPERMISSION TO A LOCAL MERCHANT TO BUILD A STORE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT .FISHY FRESHNESS . IN AN EFFORT TO BROADEN THE SHEIK'S OUTLOOK, OILMENAND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN HIM REDCARPET TRIPS TO PARIS,LONDON AND NEW YORK . WHAT INTERESTED HIM MOST WAS THE LARGE NUMBER OFAUTOMOBILES IN THE THREE CITIES . " KEEP THE CARS GOING, " HE SAIDEARNESTLY, THINKING HAPPILY OF THE FUTURE CONSUMPTION OF ABU DHABIGASOLINE . NEW YORK CITY STRUCK HIM AS A " TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOTCIVILIZED . THEY LIVE LIKE ANTS OR SWALLOWS IN CLIFFS . THE SUN NEVERGETS DOWN INTO THE STREETS . " HE WAS APPALLED BY TV WESTERNS : " ALLTHAT SHOOTING UPSETS THE BASIS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT ! " WHAT DELIGHTSSHAKHBUT IS THE TRADITIONAL LIFE OF HIS PEOPLE . " THE THING THATPLEASES ME MOST, " HE SAYS, " IS HUNTING FOR BUSTARDS WITH OUR FALCONS. IT'S TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE FALCON FIGHTING THE BUSTARD AND KILLING IT. EACH FALCON HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL OWNER AND REFUSES TO HUNT FOR ANYONEELSE . " THE SHEIK IS ALSO A CONNOISSEUR OF CAMEL'S MILK HIS ONLY DRINKAND CAN TELL BY THE MILK'S TASTE WHAT THE CAMEL HAS BEEN EATING ANDWHERE IT WAS IN THE DESERT FOR THE BEST MILK, HE EXPLAINS, WE FEEDCAMELSON SEA MANGROVE AND DRIED FISH . THIS GIVES THE MILK A SLIGHTLY FISHYFRESHNESS WE APPRECIATE . " SHAKHBUT ONCE OWNED A CADILLAC, BUT WHEN ITFINALLY BROKE DOWN HE JUST ABANDONED IT . NOW HE MAKES HIS STATE VISITSIN A BONE-JARRING LAND-ROVER, BUT WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM . " I DID ALL MYTRAVELING BY CAMEL IN THE OLD DAYS, " HE SIGHS, " BUT NOW I HAVE TO GOBY CAR BECAUSE IF THE RULER WENT BY CAMEL, PEOPLE WOULD THINK ITPECULIAR . /
