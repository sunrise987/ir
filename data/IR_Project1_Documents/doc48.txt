AS A WRITER, CHARLESDE GAULLE HAS THE GIFT OF CLARITY, AS A POLITICIAN HE KNOWS THE USES OFAMBIGUITY, AND AS A STATESMAN HE HAS SHOWN REMARKABLE CONSISTENCY .FROM NEARLY 30 YEARS OF WRITINGS AND REMARKS COME THESE AFFIRMATIONS OFHIS ASPIRATIONS AND AMBITIONS : ON NATO ALLIANCES DO NOT SETTLEEVERYTHING . (1963) THE GLORY OF FRANCE OUR COUNTRY, WITH HER TINTEDSKY, HER VARIED CONTOURS, HER FERTILE SOIL, OUR FIELDS FULL OF FINECORN AND VINES AND LIVESTOCK, OUR INDUSTRY, OUR GIFTS OF INITIATIVE,ADAPTATION AND SELF-RESPECT, MAKE US, ABOVE ALL OTHERS, A RACE CREATEDFOR BRILLIANT DEEDS . THE SWORD IS THE AXIS OF THE WORLD, AND GREATNESSCANNOT BE SHARED . (1934) . THE EMOTIONAL SIDE OF ME TENDS TOIMAGINE FRANCE, LIKE THE PRINCESS IN THE STORIES OR THE MADONNA IN THEFRESCOES, AS DEDICATED TO AN EXALTED AND EXCEPTIONAL DESTINY . BUT THEPOSITIVE SIDE OF MY MIND ALSO ASSURES ME THAT FRANCE IS NOT REALLYHERSELF UNLESS IN THE FRONT RANK ; THAT ONLY VAST ENTERPRISES ARECAPABLE OF COUNTERBALANCING THE DIVISIVE FERMENTS WHICH ARE INHERENT INHER PEOPLE . IN SHORT, TO MY MIND, FRANCE CANNOT BE FRANCE WITHOUTGREATNESS . (2955) . WHO IN GOOD FAITH CAN DISPUTE THE FACTTHAT FRANCE MUST HELP TO BUILD WESTERN EUROPE INTO AN ORGANIZED UNIONOF STATES SO THAT GRADUALLY THERE MAY BE ESTABLISHED THE MOST POWERFUL,PROSPEROUS AND INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY COMPLEX INTHE WORLD ? (1962) FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS THE EQUILIBRIUM OFEUROPE, THE GUARANTEE OF PEACE ALONG THE RHINE, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEVISTULA, DANUBE AND BALKAN STATES, THE CREATION OF SOME FORM OFASSOCIATION WITH THE PEOPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO WHOM WE HAVE OPENEDTHE DOORS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AN ORGANIZATION OF NATIONS WHICHWILL BE SOMETHING MORE THAN AN ARENA FOR DISPUTES BETWEEN AMERICA ANDRUSSIA THESE SURELY ARE OUR GREAT INTERESTS IN TOMORROW'S WORLD .(1944) . PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO RENEW FRANCO-RUSSIANSOLIDARITY IN SOME FASHION, WHICH, EVEN IF REPEATEDLY BETRAYED ANDREPUDIATED,REMAINS NOLESS A PART OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS BOTH WITH REGARD TO THEGERMAN DANGER AND THE ANGLO-SAXON EFFORTS TO ASSERT THEIR HEGEMONY .(1944) . I AM CONVINCED THAT IF FRANCE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TOSUMMON EUROPE TO ORGANIZE ITSELF, IN PARTICULAR WITH GERMAN HELP, THEWHOLE EUROPEAN ATMOSPHERE FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS WOULD BECHANGED . (1950) THE AMERICANS IN THE MORTAL DANGERS WE FRENCH HAVESURVIVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY, THE U.S . HAS NOT GIVEN USTHE IMPRESSION THAT IT REGARDS ITS OWN DESTINY AS LINKED WITH THAT OFFRANCE, THAT IT WISHES FRANCE TO BE GREAT AND STRONG, THAT IT IS DOINGALL IT CAN TO HELP HER TO REMAIN OR BECOME SO ONCE AGAIN . (1945) .THE ALLIANCE HAS BEEN BUILT ON THE BASIS OF INTEGRATION, INWHICH THE DEFENSE OF EACH OF THE COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE, APARTFROM ENGLAND, HAS NO NATIONAL CHARACTER, IN WHICH IN FACT ALL ISCOMMANDED BY THE AMERICANS, AND IT IS THE AMERICANS WHO DETERMINE THEUSE OF YOUR ATOMIC WEAPONS . (1960) . THE AMERICAN INTEREST ISNOT ALWAYS THE FRENCH INTEREST . THIS WILL BE MORE AND MORE TRUE IN THEFUTURE, WHICH WILL GIVE EUROPE A GREATER AND GREATER WEIGHT, AND WHICHWILL THEREFORE CONTRIBUTE TO DIMINISHING THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THE U.S. (1963) . FOLLOWING BRITAIN, OTHER STATES WOULD WANT TO ENTERTHE COMMON MARKET . IN THE END THERE WOULD APPEAR A COLOSSAL ATLANTICCOMMUNITY UNDER AMERICAN DEPENDENCE AND LEADERSHIP, WHICH WOULD SOONCOMPLETELY SWALLOW UP THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . (1963) BRITAIN & EUROPEENGLAND AND FRANCE WILL TOGETHER CREATE PEACE, AS TWICE IN 30 YEARSTHEY HAVE TOGETHER CONFRONTED WAR . (1944) . ENGLAND HASTURNED OVER TO THE AMERICANS WHAT MEAGER ATOMIC FORCES SHE HAD . SHECOULD HAVE TURNED THEM OVER TO EUROPE . THUS SHE HAS MADE HER CHOICE .I AM DISTRESSED TO SEE ENGLAND ALIGN HERSELF WITH THE U.S., FOR SHERISKS ACTING LIKE THEIR TRAVELING SALESMAN . THE ENGLISH WILL NO DOUBTENTER THE COMMON MARKET, PERHAPS IN 50 YEARS, AND I WILL WITHOUT DOUBTNO LONGER BE HERE . (1963) THIRD FORCE I HAVE SOUGHT TO ASSURE FRANCEPRIMACY IN WESTERN EUROPE BY PREVENTING THE RISE OF A NEW REICH THATMIGHT AGAIN THREATEN ITS SAFETY ; TO COOPERATE WITH EAST AND WEST AND,IF NEED BE, CONTRACT THE NECESSARY ALLIANCES ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHERWITHOUT EVER ACCEPTING ANY KIND OF DEPENDENCY ; TO PERSUADE THE STATESALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL,ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OFTHE THREE WORLD POWERS AND, IF NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THESOVIET AND ANGLO-AMERICAN CAMPS . SINCE 1940, MY EVERY WORD AND DEEDHAS BEEN DEDICATED TO ESTABLISHING THESE POSSIBILITIES . (1955) .ONLY FRANCE KNOWS THAT PEACE OR WAR WILL BE DECIDED IN EUROPE. YES, IT IS EUROPE, IT IS ALL EUROPE THAT WILL DECIDE THE DESTINY OFTHE WORLD . IF THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE, ON WHICHEVER SIDE OF THE CURTAINTHEY FIND THEMSELVES, WANT TO ESTABLISH CONCORD AMONG THEMSELVES, THENPEACE WILL BE ASSURED . BUT IF EUROPE REMAINS DIVIDED IN TWO OPPOSEDFACTIONS, WAR WILL SOONER OR LATER DESTROY THE HUMAN RACE . (1959) .WHO CAN SAY WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING ? WHO CAN SAY THAT, INTHE FUTURE, IF THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND SHOULD CHANGE COMPLETELY, THETWO POWERS (THE U.S . AND RUSSIA) THAT HAVE THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY WILLNOT AGREE TO DIVIDE THE WORLD ? WHO CAN SAY THAT IF THE OCCASIONARISES, EACH OF THE TWO, WHILE DECIDING NOT TO LAUNCH ITS MISSILES ATTHE MAIN ENEMY, SO THAT IT MIGHT ITSELF BE SPARED, WILL NOT CRUSH THEOTHERS ? IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT, ON SOME AWFUL DAY, WESTERNEUROPE WOULD BE WIPED OUT FROM MOSCOW AND CENTRAL EUROPE FROMWASHINGTON . AND WHO CAN EVEN SAY THAT THE TWO RIVALS, AFTER I KNOW NOTWHAT POLITICAL UPHEAVAL, WILL NOT UNITE ? (1959) ON LEADERSHIP GLORYGIVES HERSELF ONLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF HER . (1934) .IT WAS BY ACTING AS THE INFLEXIBLE CHAMPION OF THE NATION ANDTHE STATE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GATHER THE CONSENT, EVEN THEENTHUSIASM, OF THE FRENCH, AND TO WIN FROM FOREIGNERS RESPECT ANDCONSIDERATION . THOSE WHO WERE OFFENDED BY THIS INTRANSIGENCE WEREUNWILLING TO SEE THAT FOR ME THE SLIGHTEST WAVERING WOULD HAVE BROUGHTCOLLAPSE . LIMITED AND ALONE THOUGH I WAS, I HAD TO CLIMB TO THEHEIGHTS AND NEVER THEN TO COME DOWN . (1940, DESCRIBING HIS WARTIMELEADERSHIP) . EVERY MAN OF ACTION HAS A STRONG DOSE OFEGOTISM, PRIDE, HARDNESS AND CUNNING . BUT ALL THOSE THINGS WILL BEFORGIVEN HIM IF HE CAN MAKE OF THEM THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE GREAT ENDS .ALOOFNESS, CHARACTER, AND THE PERSONIFICATION OF GREATNESS, THESEQUALITIES IT IS THAT SURROUND WITH PRESTIGE THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED TOCARRY A BURDEN WHICH IS TOO HEAVY FOR LESSER MORTALS .
