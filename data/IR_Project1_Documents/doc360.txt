ITALY " THIS SHIP IS LEAKING " ITALIANDEMOCRACY LAST WEEK WAS STAGGERING TOWARD A POLITICAL CRISIS THAT MAYWELL PROVE TO BE THE WORST SINCE THE COMMUNISTS WERE NARROWLY DEFEATED15 YEARS AGO . ON THE VERGE OF ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT WAS A MARXISTPARTY THAT, AT ITS WORST, IS OPENLY ALLIED WITH THE COMMUNISTS AND, ATBEST, IS ONLY A LUKEWARM AND NEUTRALITY-MINDED ADHERENT OF THE WEST .SEEKING PERMISSION . WHEN THE ORIGINAL APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TOTHE LEFT) WAS ENGINEERED A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, IT HAPPENEDLARGELY BECAUSE THE LONG-RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS FELT THEMSELVESSLIPPING AT THE POLLS AND GENERALLY DECLINING IN VIGOR COMPARED TOTHEIR EARLY POSTWAR DAYS . THE SOLUTION ADVANCED BY LEFT-WING CHRISTIANDEMOCRATS, WITH THE ZEALOUS BACKING OF WASHINGTON, WAS A SERIES OFREFORMS IN EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE AND TAXATION, ALL INVOLVING LARGEMEASURES OF GOVERNMENT PLANNING . SINCE THIS PROGRAM WAS OPPOSED BY THERIGHTIST PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT, INCLUDING THE FREE-ENTERPRISINGLIBERALS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS NEEDED SUPPORT ELSEWHERE TO BE ABLETO FORM A MAJORITY . THEY SOUGHT IT FROM PIETRO NENNI'S LEFT-WINGSOCIALISTS . ACCORDING TO THE APERTURA AGREEMENT, THE NENNI SOCIALISTSDID NOT ENTER THE GOVERNMENT BUT SUPPORTED IT IN PARLIAMENT . IN THEPROCESS, SOME CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HOPED, THE NENNI SOCIALISTS WOULD BEWOOED INTO BREAKING THEIR LONGSTANDING ALLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNISTS .AS IT TURNED OUT, THE APERTURA FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OR ANYTHINGELSE EXCEPT THE UNNECESSARY NATIONALIZATION OF ITALY'S ELECTRICALINDUSTRY .IT ALSO PAVED THE WAY, AT LAST SPRING'S ELECTIONS, FOR HEAVY GAINS BYBOTH THE COMMUNISTS AND THE LIBERALS . SINCE THEN ITALY HAS BEEN RULEDBY THE CARETAKER GOVERNMENT OF PREMIER GIOVANNI LEONE . BUT BOTH PIETRONENNI AND THE MAJORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS UNDER ALDO MOROWANTED TO REVIVE THE APERTURA, THIS TIME WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTSACTUALLY IN THE GOVERNMENT . LAST WEEK, PIETRO NENNI TURNED TO HISDEEPLY DIVIDED PARTY TO GET ITS PERMISSION TO NEGOTIATE SUCH A DEAL .OUTSIDE ROME'S MASSIVE MARBLE PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES, 600 SOCIALISTDELEGATES PARKED THEIR FIATS, LOOKING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE BOURGEOISCONVENTIONEERS . BUT INSIDE, SUGGESTING THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH OLDDOGMATISTS NEW TRICKS, THE STAGE WAS BEDECKED WITH RED FLAGS AND THESOCIALIST EMBLEM : A HAMMER, SICKLE AND A RISING SUN . EYES GREW MISTYWITH TEARS AS THE AFFLUENT CROWD BROKE OUT IN EMOTIONAL RENDITIONS OFTHE INTERNATIONALE AND BANDIERA ROSSA (RED FLAG) . SPOUTING JARGON .TODAY, SAID PIETRO NENNI FRANKLY, " SOCIALIST PARTICIPATION IN ACOALITION GOVERNMENT IS NOT A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE BUT OF POLITICALOPPORTUNITY . " THEN HE LAUNCHED INTO A PRECARIOUS BALANCING ACT . HEDENOUNCED THE COMMUNISTS' " ARID THEORIES OF POWER, " AND URGED THEPARTY TO DROP ITS RULE DEMANDING COOPERATION WITH THE REDS IN LOCALELECTIONS . BUT HE DID NOT AS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HAD WANTED HIM TOASK THAT SUCH ELECTORAL ALLIANCES BE SPECIFICALLY RULED OUT . INFOREIGN AFFAIRS, NENNI ADVOCATED A VAGUE POLICY OF " POSITIVENEUTRALISM, " WHICH MEANS UNENTHUSIASTIC ADHERENCE TO NATO ANDOPPOSITION TO THE U.S . PLAN FOR A MULTINATIONAL SURFACE FLEET EQUIPPEDWITH POLARIS MISSILES .THE POWERFUL PRO-COMMUNIST WING OFNENNI'S SOCIALISTS DENOUNCED THE PROPOSED COALITION GOVERNMENT AS "UNACCEPTABLE TO A WORKING-CLASS PARTY . " THE BALANCE OF POWER RESTEDWITH THE SOCIALISTS' NO . 2 LEADER, RICCARDO LOMBARDI, WHO ONLY JOINEDTHE PARTY IN 1947 (BEFORE THEN HE WAS A LEADER OF THE LEFTIST ACTIONPARTY, WHICH DIED IN 1946) AND FEVERISHLY TRIES TO MAKE UP FOR LOSTTIME BY SPOUTING ARCHAIC MARXIST JARGON . HE ALSO MADE NEUTRALISTNOISES, AND UNLIKE NENNI, HE HINTED AT FURTHER NATIONALIZATION SCHEMES. STILL, WHILE HE DENOUNCED THE " MENACE OF CAPITALISM, " LOMBARDIADMITTED THAT WITHIN A DECADE THE CAPITALISTS MIGHT SOLVE ITALY'SSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO THE SOCIALISTS HAD BETTER GET INTO THEGOVERNMENT NOW TO SHARETHE CREDIT AND INFLUENCE EVENTS . THUS, IN THE END, LOMBARDI THREW HISSUPPORT TO NENNI, BUT WITH SO MANY QUALIFICATIONS THAT NENNI MIGHT YETFIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK OUT A COALITION WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS. OF 101 SEATS IN THE PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, TWO WENT TOINDEPENDENTS, 49 TO PROCOMMUNISTS AND 59 TO DELEGATES FAVORING THECOALITION . OF THESE 59, HOWEVER, 16 ARE HELD BY LOMBARDI SUPPORTERS .VIEWING HIS SHAKY VICTORY, THE AGING (72), AILING NENNI DECLARED : "THIS SHIP IS LEAKING ON ALL SIDES . " MORE MODERATE ? RIGHT-WINGCHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, WHO HAD OPPOSED THE APERTURA IN THE FIRST PLACE,WARNED DIRELY AGAINST TAKING THE SOCIALISTS ON BOARD AT ALL . SAIDLIBERAL LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI : " COLLABORATION WITH THE SOCIALISTSSIGNIFIES THE ABANDONMENT OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM,ABANDONMENT OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE WEST, ABANDONMENT OF A FREE ECONOMYAND AN OPEN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY . " U.S . POLICYMAKERS, ALTHOUGH THEY NOLONGER SUPPORT THE APERTURA WITH THE SAME OLD ENTHUSIASM, PERCEIVE NOSUCH PERILS ; THEY ARGUE THAT NENNI & CO . WOULD BECOME MORE MODERATEAS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAN IF THEY REMAINED ON THE OUTSIDELOOKING IN . BESIDES, INSIST DEFENDERS OF THE APERTURA, THE ALTERNATIVETO A CENTER-LEFT ALLIANCE IS A CENTER-RIGHT COALITION WHICH COULD NOTCOMMAND A MAJORITY IN THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT WITHOUT THE VOTES OFMONARCHISTS AND NEO-FASCISTS . MANY ITALIAN RIGHT-WINGERS ACTUALLY WANTTHE APERTURA GOVERNMENT FORMED, HOPING THAT IT WILL FAIL, THEREBYFORCING NEW ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE RIGHT-WING PARTIES EXPECT TO MAKEFURTHER GAINS FOR COMRADE PALMIRO TOGLIATTI, HE CHIDED NENNI FOR HISANTI-COMMUNIST TALK AND SWEETLY URGED BOTH THE SOCIALISTS AND THELEFT-WING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS TO ACCEPT COOPERATION WITH THE COMMUNISTPARTY .
