THENTHERE IS THE STEREOTYPE BRITISH MALE : A STOICAL, PIPE-PUFFING,BAGGY-TWEEDS TYPE WHO ESCHEWS SEX FOR A ROUSING GAME OF DARTS IN THELOCAL PUB, AND WHEN HE DOES INDULGE IS AWKWARD AND PASSIONLESS .BRITISH WOMEN ARE, FOR LACK OF PRACTICE, FRIGID . NONE OF THESE THINGSHAS EVER BEEN VERY TRUE . BUT NOWADAYS, AS FAR AS SEX IS CONCERNEDANYWAY, BRITONS ARE SHATTERING THE WORLD'S ILLUSIONS ABOUT THEIRPROPENSITIES AND PROWESS . IN THE BARGAIN, THEY ARE SHOCKING THEMSELVES. " ARE VIRGINS OBSOLETE . ON THE ISLAND WHERE THE SUBJECT HAS LONGBEEN TABOO IN POLITE SOCIETY, SEX HAS EXPLODED ON THE NATIONALCONSCIOUSNESS AND INTO NATIONAL HEADLINES . " ARE WE GOING SEX CRAZY? " ASKS THE LONDON DAILY HERALD . " IS CHASTITY OUTMODED ? " ASKSA SCHOOL MAGAZINE FOR TEEN-AGERS . " ARE VIRGINS OBSOLETE ? " IS THEQUESTION POSED BY THE SOBER NEW STATESMAN . THE ANSWERS VARY, BUT ONETHING IS CLEAR : BRITAIN IS BEING BOMBARDED WITH A BARRAGE OFFRANKNESS ABOUT SEX AND FLOODED WITH A PUBLIC QUESTIONING OF THELONG-ESTABLISHED VICTORIAN MORAL STANDARDS . WROTE THE ARCHBISHOP OFCANTERBURY, IN A RECENT SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLE, " TODAY THERE IS IN OURSOCIETY AN IMMENSE OUTBREAK OF PREOCCUPATION WITH VENUS . THERE IS ADWELLING UPON SEX : THE SEX PROBLEM, THE ADJUSTMENTS OF SEX,INSTRUCTION FOR SEX, ADVENTURES OF SEX, STORIES OF SEX, WHAT TO DO WITHSEX, BRIGHTER AND BETTER SEX . " AND THE CANDOR WITH WHICH THEONCE FORBIDDEN SUBJECT IS BEING EXPLORED IS POSITIVELYASTONISHING . IT IS THE DECOROUS BRITISH BROADCASTING CORP . THAT LEADSTHE DISCUSSION THESE DAYS . BBC PROGRAMS HAVE INCLUDED A LECTURE ON THEARGUMENTS FOR PREMARITAL INTERCOURSE, A DISCUSSION OF HOMOSEXUALITY(KNOWN ON THE CONTINENT AS LE VICE ANGLAIS), A DRAMA ABOUT ANABORTIONIST, AND ANOTHER PLAY ABOUT MEN REMINISCING ABOUT THEIR PASTSEX LIFE ( " HER BREASTS COULD FILL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES " ) . ON THEPOPULAR SATIRICAL SHOW THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS, THE YOUNGESTABLISHMENT TYPES POKE A KIND OF SEXUAL FUN THAT WOULD MAKE AMERICA'SFCC BOSS NEWTON MINOW TURN PALE . TAKING OFF ON A GOVERNMENT REPORTTHAT ONE BABY IN EVERY EIGHT BORN IN LONDON IS ILLEGITIMATE,BRASSY SINGER MILLICENT MARTIN LAMENTED AS SHE ROCKED A CRADLE : DON'TYOU WEEP, MY LITTLE BABY CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A DAD . GO TO SLEEP, MYLITTLE BABY, THINGS AREN'T REALLY QUITE SO BAD . THERE'S NO REASON ANYLONGER WHY YOU OUGHT TO FEEL SO BLUE . THE WORLD IS FULL OF BASTARDSJUST LIKE YOU . A DEBRIS OF CONVICTIONS . FACT IS, BOTH ON AND OFF THEAIR WAVES, THE BRITISH ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THEIR SEARCH FOR WHATSOME CALL " A NEW MORALITY " TO FIT THE HUSHED-UP FACTS OF LIFE . " THEPOPULAR MORALITY IS NOW A WASTELAND, " SAID DR . GEORGE MORRISONCARSTAIRS, 46, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE AT EDINBURGHUNIVERSITY, IN A RECENT BBC LECTURE . " IT IS LITTERED WITH THE DEBRISOF BROKEN CONVICTIONS . A NEW CONCEPT IS EMERGING, OF SEXUALRELATIONSHIPS AS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE, BUT ALSO AS A MUTUALENCOUNTERING OF PERSONALITIES IN WHICH EACH EXPLORES THE OTHER AND ATTHE SAME TIME DISCOVERS NEW DEPTHS IN HIMSELF OR HERSELF . " IN AVIOLENTLY CONTROVERSIAL REPORT, A GROUP OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OFFRIENDS ATTACKED THE ONUS ATTACHED TO " A GREAT INCREASE IN ADOLESCENTSEXUAL INTIMACY " AND PREMARITAL AFFAIRS . " IT IS FAIRLY COMMON INBOTH YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND INTEGRITYTO HAVE ONE OR TWO LOVE AFFAIRS, INVOLVING INTERCOURSE, BEFORE THEYFIND THE PERSON THEY WILL ULTIMATELY MARRY, " SAID THE REPORT . THIS,CONCLUDED THE QUAKER REPORT, IS NOT SUCH A SIN . " WHERE THERE ISGENUINE TENDERNESS, AN OPENNESS TO RESPONSIBILITY AND THE SEED OFCOMMITMENT, GOD IS SURELY NOT SHUT OUT . " A BLESSING . ALL THE HUBBUBOVER SEX HAS, TO BE SURE, CAUSED A LOT OF MISGIVINGS, AND FEW CHURCHMENSHARE THE QUAKERS' LIBERAL VIEW . BUT MOST EXPERTS AGREE WITH WRITER V. S . PRITCHETT THAT " ALLOWING FOR ITS CRUDITIES, THE SEXUALREVOLUTION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW BLESSINGS IN THE LIFE OF THISCENTURY . " THEY ATTRIBUTE THE NEW SEXUAL TOLERANCE AND THE LESSENINGOF VICTORIAN SHAME TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMBINED CAUSES : THE HEAVYIMPACT OF BOTH WORLD WARS ON THE OLD MORALITY, THE EMANCIPATION OFWOMEN FROM THE HEARTH, A GRADUAL INCREASE IN COEDUCATIONAL SCHOOLING,AND EVEN THE FACT THAT MORE BRITONS TRAVEL ABROAD FOR HOLIDAYS . BUTEXACTLY WHERE THE PRESENT ORGY OF INTROSPECTION WILL LEAD NOT EVEN THEEXPERTS CAN PREDICT . WHAT SEEMS CERTAIN, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE TYPICALENGLISHMAN OF A THOUSAND CLICHES IS DOING NO MORE THAN HE EVER DID ;HE IS MERELY HIDING IT LESS .
