COMMUNISTS THE CONFRONTATION A TROUPE OF PATAGONIAN JUGGLERSWOULD HAVE RECEIVED A WARMER WELCOME FROM THE KREMLIN . NOT A SINGLESOVIET REPORTER OR PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ON HAND WHEN THE MEN FROM PEKINGAPPEARED AT MOSCOW AIRPORT ; PRAVDA DID NOT EVEN MENTION THEIR ARRIVAL. AFTER MONTHS OF INVECTIVE, ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTERACCUSATIONS, THEGREAT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SOVIET AND CHINESE PARTY DELEGATIONS WASFINALLY AT HAND . EAST AND WEST WATCHED THE SHOWDOWN OR WHAT COULD BESEEN OF IT WITH EQUAL FASCINATION .  ALTHOUGH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV SUDDENLYDISCOVERED URGENT BUSINESS IN KIEV, THE KREMLIN WAS STIFFLY CORRECTABOUT IT ALL, SENT OUT ITS CHIEF DIALECTICIAN, LANKY, AUSTERE MIKHAILSUSLOV, TO MEET THE VISITORS . HEAD OF PEKING'S SEVEN-MAN MISSION :TENG HSIAO-PING, SECRETARYGENERAL OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY . ASTENG STEPPED OUT OF A SOVIET TU-104 JET, A CROWD OF CHINESE RESIDENTSIN MOSCOW, WATCHED CLOSELY BY A CHINESE ARMY COLONEL, SENT UP A CHEER .SUSLOV SMILED, STEPPED FORWARD AND SHOOK TENG'S HAND . BUT THE RUSSIANOMITTED THE USUAL BRIEF WELCOMING ADDRESS, INSTEAD POLITELY SUGGESTEDTHAT TENG MIGHT LIKE A TWO-HOUR REST BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS .WHEN A CHINESE DELEGATE REMARKED ON THE CHILLY 57O TEMPERATURE, AMUSCOVITE RED REPLIED : " WE HOPE IT WILL GET WARMER . " FRESH INSULTS.IN ONE SENSE, THINGS UNDOUBTEDLY GOT WARMER WHEN BOTH SIDES METBEHIND THE MASSIVE WALLS OF A RARELY USED MANSION IN THE LENIN HILLSSECTION OF MOSCOW . SUSLOV AND TENG EXCHANGED TOASTS, BUT THAT WAS JUSTROUTINE . FOR UNDER THE POSE OF POLITENESS, THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL WASBECOMING RUDER THAN EVER . WITHOUT EXPLANATION, PEKING SUDDENLYWITHDREW ITS TWO ENTRIES FROM AN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ABOUT TOOPEN IN MOSCOW . AND JUST BEFORE THE PARTY LEADERS MET, KHRUSHCHEV ANDMAO TSE-TUNG EXCHANGED A FRESH ROUND OF INSULTS OVER RED CHINA'S25-POINT DENUNCIATION OF SOVIET POLICY . ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETSTHEMSELVES REFUSED TO PUBLISH IT, MOSCOW COMPLAINED LAST WEEK THATCHINESE AGENTS HANDED OUT THE DOCUMENT IN CITIES FROM ODESSA TOLENINGRAD AND EVEN IN THE ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTER OF DUBNA, NEAR MOSCOW.CHINESE CREWS ON THE PEKING-MOSCOW EXPRESS SCATTERED BUNDLES OF THEMANIFESTO THROUGH COACH WINDOWS, USED THE TRAIN'S PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEMTO READ THE CHINESE CHARGES TO THE CAPTIVE SOVIET AUDIENCE . AFTERMOSCOW EXPELLED THREE CHINESE DIPLOMATS FOR HAVING A HAND IN THISEXTRAORDINARY CIRCULATION CAMPAIGN, PEKING OSTENTATIOUSLY WELCOMED THEMHOME WITH BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS . AT THE SAME TIME, THE CHINESE CONDEMNEDTHE SOVIET MOVE AS A VIOLATION OF ITS RIGHT, AS A GOVERNMENT, TOCIRCULATE STATEMENTS ABROAD . NONSENSE, REPLIED THE SOVIETS . WHAT GAVETHE CHINESE THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD " BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE INONE OF THE PROVINCES OF CHINA ? " SUCH TACTICS, FUMED THE KREMLIN,WERE PLAINLY A VIOLATION OF SOVIET SOVEREIGNTY : " IT IS OBVIOUS THATINSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO A RAPPROCHEMENT, THE CHINESELEADERSHIP AIMS AT AGGRAVATING DIFFERENCES . " EQUALLY MATCHED . IFTHAT WAS PEKING'S PURPOSE, IT COULD FIND NO BETTER MAN THAN TENG .SHORT, STOCKY, IN HIS 60S, TENG WAS BELIEVED BADLY CRIPPLED IN THECHINESE CIVIL WAR, STILL HAS A LIMP AND A NERVOUS TIC WHEN HE SPEAKSWHICH DOES NOT KEEP HIM FROM SPEAKING OFTEN AND ABRASIVELY . NOSTRANGER TO THE RUSSIANS, HE ATTENDED TWO PREVIOUS MOSCOW MEETINGS ONTHE SPLIT IN 1957 AND IN 1960 . A VETERAN OF MAO'S LONG MARCH TO YENANIN THE 1930S, TENG CAME TO PROMINENCE AS A POLITICAL COMMISSAR IN THEARMY, SINCE 1952 HAS RISEN TO A PLACE AMONG THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE MEN INRED CHINA'S HIERARCHY . IN PRESTIGE AND PERSONALITY HE IS A MATCH FORSUSLOV, 60, WHO FOR YEARS WAS STALIN'S IDEOLOGICAL MOUTHPIECE, AND NOWSUPPLIES KHRUSHCHEV WITH THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POLITICALSTRATEGY . INEVITABLY, WESTERN DIPLOMATS SPECULATED WHETHER THE REDCHINESE AND THE SOVIETS WOULD SEVER PARTY CONNECTIONS OR DIPLOMATICRELATIONS, CARRY THE FEUD TO A SUMMIT SESSION OF WORLD COMMUNISTLEADERS, OR MERELY AGREE TO CONTINUE TO BE DISAGREEABLE . WHATEVERHAPPENED, THE GRAVEST SCHISM IN THE HISTORY OF COMMUNISM WAS AT HAND .
