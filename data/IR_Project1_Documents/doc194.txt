THEREFORE, " YOURVOW CARRIES NO OBLIGATION AND SHOULD NOT BE EXECUTED . " LOWERED FLAGS.

IN HISDETERMINATION TO STAY IN POWER, HUSSEIN JEERED AT ISRAEL, PARTLY TOPACIFY THE PALESTINIAN ARABS, WHO MAKE UP TWO-THIRDS OF HIS 1,800,000SUBJECTS, PARTLY BECAUSE ISRAEL'S SUPPORT FOR JORDAN INDEPENDENCE IS APOLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT .

AT WEEK'S END, HOWEVER, JORDANWAS STILL INTACT, AND IT WAS THE ARAB UNITY MOVEMENT THAT WAS REELING .IT HAD TO DO WITH A CABINET CRISIS IN SYRIA BETWEEN THE MAJORITYBELONGING TO THE BAATH SOCIALIST PARTY AND THE MINORITY OF STRONGLYNASSERITE MINISTERS . THE STRUGGLE HAD BEEN BREWING FOR TWO MONTHS, ANDPRO-NASSER MINISTERS FRANKLY TOLD NEWSMEN THAT THEY INTENDED TOOVERTHROW THE BAATHISTS . THE BAATH COUNTER-STRATEGY, AS ENUNCIATED BYITS FOUNDER, MICHEL AFLAK, WAS : " DO EVERYTHING TO PRESERVE UNITY,BUT DON'T GIVE AN INCH, AND DON'T SURRENDER ANY POWER .

" THECABINET WALKOUT WAS INTENDED TO BRING THE BAATHISTS TO HEEL, AND ITWELL MIGHT . ISOLATED IN POWER, WITH THE STREET MOBS SYMPATHETIC TONASSER AND THE ARMY OF UNCERTAIN LOYALTY, BAATH'S ONLY AVAILABLE ALLIESARE THE MERCHANTS AND LANDOWNERS, WHO MOST OPPOSE NASSER'S SOCIALOBJECTIVES . THEIR EMBRACE COULD BE AS FATAL TO BAATH AS ISRAEL'S WOULDBE TO HUSSEIN .
