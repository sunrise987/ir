MALAYSIA MANILA HUMMED WITH EXCITEMENT AS DELEGATES GATHERED FOR THETHIRD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . PHALANXESOF MOTORCYCLE POLICE ESCORTED SHINY OFFICIAL LIMOUSINES TO MEETINGS ATTHE MODERNISTIC PAVILION OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD . INTHE PANELED, HIGH-CEILINGED CONFERENCE ROOM AND AT DIPLOMATIC COCKTAILPARTIES, AN ENDLESS STREAM OF DIGNITARIES STROLLED UP TO GREET THE MANWHO WAS THE FOCUS OF EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, MALAYA'S STOCKY, SMILINGPRIME MINISTER ABDUL RAHMAN, 60, THE GOLF-PLAYING EX-PLAYBOY WHO THISSUMMER WILL BRING INTO BEING A NEW ASIAN NATION . TO ONE AND ALL, ABDULRAHMAN HAPPILY TOOK CREDIT FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MALAYSIANFEDERATION . AS HE PUTS IT, " I AM THE FATHER OF MALAYSIA . " STRICTLYSPEAKING, THIS IS NOT TRUE ; THE IDEA HAS LONG BEEN THE DREAM OF ASIANNATIONALISTS . FOR YEARS, BRITAIN TOO HAS ADVOCATED THE PLAN AS A NEATWAY TO TIE UP ALL ITS REMAINING ASIAN COLONIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OFHONG KONG) INTO ONE TIDY INDEPENDENT PACKAGE . BUT THE TUNKU (IT MEANSPRINCE) WAS THE INDISPENSABLE CATALYST WITHOUT WHOM MALAYSIA COULD NOTHAVE BEEN ACHIEVED . HE WOOED, BULLIED AND CAJOLED THE FOUR OTHERCOUNTRIES INTO THE FEDERATION AGREEMENT, WAS THE ONLY LOGICAL CHOICE TOSERVE AS THE NEW NATION'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER . HAPPY, NOT MIGHTY .UNLIKE MOST OTHER NEW ASIAN LEADERS, ABDUL RAHMAN IS NO RABIDNATIONALIST . HE HAS REMAINED ON CLOSE, FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THEBRITISH, HAS NO INTEREST IN PIE-IN-THE-SKY ECONOMIC SCHEMES . HISPOLITICAL AIMS ARE SIMPLE : " FOOD INSTEAD OF BULLETS, CLOTHINGINSTEAD OF UNIFORMS, HOUSES INSTEAD OF BARRACKS . " HIS NEW NATION HASA COMBAT ARMY OF ONLY SEVEN BATTALIONS AND AN AIR FORCE SO SMALL THATTHE PILOTS OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE FINDING A FOURTH FOR BRIDGE . " MYAMBITION IS NOT A MIGHTY MALAYSIA, " SAYS ABDUL RAHMAN, " BUT HAPPYMALAYSIA . " BUT MANY PRESSING PROBLEMS THREATEN THE TUNKU'S AMBITION .MALAYSIA'S CURRENT PROSPERITY IS ENDANGERED BY ITS DEPENDENCE ON AONE-CROP ECONOMY . SYNTHETICS HAVE ALREADY CAPTURED HALF THE WORLD'SANNUAL 5,000,000-TON RUBBER MARKET AND FORCED DOWN THE PRICE OF LATEX .ON TOP OF THIS, BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES ARE FAST DEPLETING . TO COUNTERTHE ECONOMIC THREAT, MALAYA HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUSDIVERSIFICATION PROGRAM, IS OFFERING A FIVEYEAR TAX HOLIDAY TO NEWINDUSTRIES AND PUSHING A BIG LAND-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR NEW CASHCROPS . POLITICALLY, MALAYSIA HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME ACUTE PAINS. FEARFUL THAT A STABLE NEW NATION WILL CURB COMMUNIST SUBVERSION INSOUTHEAST ASIA, RUSSIA HAS BRANDED THE FEDERATION " A CUNNING INVENTIONOF LONDON " SET UP WITH THE " UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT OF U.S . IMPERIALISTS. " BOTH NEIGHBORING INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE LAUNCHED ACAMPAIGN OF INVECTIVE AGAINST THE WHOLE IDEA .WALLS OF PREJUDICE . BY FARMALAYSIA'S MOST COMPLEX AND FESTERING PROBLEM IS THE SIMMERING RACIALHOSTILITY BETWEEN THE NEW NATION'S CHINESE AND MALAY POPULATIONS .THROUGHOUT THE FEDERATION, THE ASTUTE, PROSPEROUS, HARD-BARGAININGCHINESE DOMINATE BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND TRADE, HAVE ECONOMICALLY FAROUTSTRIPPED THE RURAL, EASYGOING MALAYS . CHINESE TYCOONS CONTROL NORTHBORNEO'S BOOMING YOUNG TIMBER INDUSTRY AND SARAWAK'S VAST, ROLLINGPEPPER GARDENS ; IN MALAYA, ABDUL RAHMAN'S GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLAINEDTHAT THE RICH, INBRED CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS ERECTED A " WALLOF PREJUDICE " AGAINST AMBITIOUS YOUNG MALAY BUSINESSMEN . THE MALAYSHAVE BUILT SOME WALLS OF THEIR OWN . BY MALAYAN LAW, ONLY ONEQUARTER OFTHE GOVERNMENT JOBS CAN GO TO NON-MALAYS, WHILE MALAYS GET SPECIALCONCESSIONS IN THE GRANTING OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND LICENSES FOR NEWBUSINESSES . RIGID CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR THECHINESE (MALAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY CITIZENS), AND THE BORNEO TERRITORIESPLAN IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP CHINESE BUSINESSMEN OUT . "SPECIAL PRIVILEGES ARE LIKE A GOLF HANDICAP, " RATIONALIZES MALAYA'SCHINESE FINANCE MINISTER TAN SIEW SIN . " THEY ARE NOT TO HOLD THECHINESE DOWN, BUT TO HELP THE MALAYS ALONG . " GOLF EVERY MORNING . ITIS IRONICALLY FITTING THAT THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS OF FEDERATION ARETHE PROVINCE OF A MAN WHO, ON THE FACE OF IT, IS SO UNCOMPLICATEDHIMSELF . " I AM A LAZY MAN, " ADMITS ABDUL RAHMAN CHEERFULLY, AND SIXYEARS AS MALAYA'S PRIME MINISTER HAVE NOT ALTERED HIS EASYGOING WAYS .THE TUNKU PLAYS GOLF EVERY MORNING (HANDICAP : 24), CHECKS THE RACINGCALENDAR BEFORE MAKING ADVANCE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENTS, ALWAYS TAKES ANAP IN THE AFTERNOON . AN AVID SOCCER FAN AND SPORTS-CAR BUFF, HE ISCHRONICALLY LATE FOR APPOINTMENTS, EXPLAINS : " BEING PUNCTUAL ALWAYSWEARS ME OUT . " THE TUNKU HAS THE CHARISMA OF THE REALLY SUCCESSFULPOLITICIAN . HIS TITLE DRAWS ENORMOUS RESPECT FROM THE MASSES, AND ATTHE SAME TIME HIS GENUINE CHARM AND EASYGOING MANNER QUICKLY WIN THEIRCONFIDENCE . THOUGH HE IS A DEVOUT MOSLEM, ABDUL RAHMAN ENJOYS BRANDYAND SODA ; HE IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT CURRY COOK . WITH HIS THIRD WIFE,SHARIFAH RODZIAH, AND THEIR FOUR ADOPTED CHILDREN (TWO OF WHOM ARECHINESE), THE TUNKU LEADS A LIFE OF CHEERFUL DISORDER IN KUALALUMPUR'S OPEN, AIRY PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE, ALLOWS THE 70 CHILDRENOF HIS SERVANTS THE RUN OF THE HOUSE ; VISITING DIPLOMATS ARE OFTENSURPRISED DURING A CONFERENCE TO SEE A SERVANT'S CHILD WANDER INTO THESITTING ROOM AND CLIMB UP ONTO THE TUNKU'S LAP . THE TUNKU HAS SOLVEDTHE PROBLEM OF PAPER WORK SIMPLY : HE DOES NOT READ IT . HE HAS ALWAYSHAD AN AVERSION TO THE PRINTED PAGE, AS A STUDENT PICKED UP THE KNACKOF ABSORBING PERTINENT PASSAGES FROM BOOKS OR PAPERS THAT WERE READALOUD TO HIM . BUT THOUGH HE HAS NO INTELLECTUAL PRETENSIONS, THE TUNKUCOMMANDS UNSWERVING LOYALTY FROM HIS BRILLIANT SUBORDINATES FOR HISALMOST CHARMED ABILITY TO AVOID POLITICAL MISTAKES . SAYS AN AIDE : "HE UNDERSTANDS THE MALAY MIND BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE EVER HAS . "ABDUL RAHMAN AGREES . " I HAVE THE FEEL OF THE PEOPLE, " HE SAYS . " IHAVE THE TOUCH . " THETUNKU'S FIRST WIFE, WHO DIED OF MALARIA IN 1935, WAS THE MOTHER OF HISTWO CHILDREN, DAUGHTER KATHIJAH, 29, WIFE OF A MALAYAN STUDYING INBRITAIN, AND SON NERANG, 27, NOW A MAJOR IN THE MALAYAN ARMY . HISSECOND WIFE WAS A WHITE ENGLISHWOMAN, VIOLET COULSON, WHOM HE MARRIEDOVER THE PROTESTS OF HIS FAMILY ; THEY WERE DIVORCED IN 1946 .THE PLAYBOY PRINCE . ABDUL RAHMANWAS THE SEVENTH SON OF HIS FATHER'S SIXTH WIFE AND, WITH HIS 44BROTHERS AND SISTERS, LIVED THE PLUSH LIFE BEFITTING THE OFFSPRING OFTHE SULTAN OF KEDAH . HIS SIAMESE MOTHER DEMANDED THAT HE BE CARRIED TOSCHOOL ON THE SHOULDERS OF A RETAINER, AND THOUGH HE WAS AN INDIFFERENTSTUDENT, HIS ROYAL BIRTH WON HIM A SCHOLARSHIP TO CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HEBEGAN TO READ LAW . BUT THE TUNKU SKIPPED MOST OF HIS LECTURES, SELDOMMISSED A TEA OR DINNERDANCE, DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF MAINLY BY PICKING UP28 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN HIS SILVER RILEY WITH RED FENDERS . NOTUNEXPECTEDLY, THE PLAYBOY PRINCE FLUNKED HIS BAR EXAMS . SO FAR DOWNTHE LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE OF EVER ATTAINING HISFATHER'S SULTANATE, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO MALAYA AS A MINOR CIVILSERVANT IN A NUMBER OF REMOTE OUTPOSTS . ON FOOT AND ON ELEPHANT, HETRAVELED THROUGH THE BUSH GETTING TO KNOW THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE, ONCEEVEN WORKED AS A MANUAL LABORER TO HELP BUILD A NEW MOSQUE, WHICH THEGRATEFUL MALAYS NAMED RAHMANIAH AFTER HIM . WORLD WAR II AND JAPAN'SSWIFT CONQUEST OF THE MALAYAN PENINSULA HASTENED ABDUL RAHMAN'SMATURITY . AS A USEFUL DISTRICT OFFICER, THE TUNKU WAS KEPT ON THE JOBBY THE JAPANESE . SECRETLY, HOWEVER, HE HELPED HIDE ESCAPEES FROMJAPANESE DEATH CAMPS, KEPT IN CONTACT WITH BRITISH GUERRILLA UNITS,WHICH WERE SUPPLYING ARMS TO ANTI-JAPANESE COMMUNIST IRREGULARS IN THEJUNGLES . " WHO THE HELL IS HE ? " ABDUL RAHMAN WAS ALSO IN CONTACTWITH THE MALAYAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN TO TAKE ROOT WHEN THEJAPANESE OUSTED THE BRITISH . WITH THE END OF THE WAR, AT THE AGE OF42, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE, BEGAN TO PLAYA LARGER PART IN THE CAUSE OF MERDEKA (FREEDOM) . HE INSISTED THAT ITWAS THE DUTY OF EVERY MALAY IN BRITAIN TO JOIN THE NATIONALISTIC MALAYSOCIETY . BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE,YOUNGER MALAY STUDENTS LOOKED TO HIM AS THEIR LEADER, CALLED HIMBECAUSE OF HIS DARKER SKIN " BLACK UNCLE . " IN FIERY POLITICAL BULLSESSIONS WITH YOUTHFUL FOLLOWER TUN ABDUL RAZAK, THE SEEDS OF A FUTUREPOLITICAL PARTNERSHIP WERE BEING SOWN ; TODAY RAZAK IS THE MOSTTRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS CABINET . BACK HOME, THE MIDDLE-AGING LAWYERJOINED THE UNITED MALAY NATIONALIST ORGANIZATION, SLOWLY BEGAN BUILDINGUP A POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN HIS NATIVE KEDAH . IN OTHER MALAY STATES,THE TUNKU'S FIREBRAND FOLLOWERS FROM THE LONDON DAYS BEGAN PUSHING HIMFOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP ; FINALLY, IN 1951, ABDUL RAHMAN TOOK OVER ASBOSS OF THE U.M.N.O . " NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM, " AN OFFICIALRECALLS . " I REMEMBER PEOPLE ASKING " WHO THE HELL IS HE ? " ' THEYSOON FOUND OUT . CONVINCED THAT HE COULD ONLY ACHIEVE NATIONALLEADERSHIP AT THE HEAD OF A MULTIRACIAL UNITED FRONT, ABDUL RAHMANMUTED HOTLY ANTI-CHINESE SENTIMENT IN HIS OWN MALAY PARTY, STUMPED THECOUNTRY URGING CHINESE AND INDIAN LEADERS TO UNITE BEHIND HIM UNDER THEBANNER OF A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE PARTY . TO FINANCE HISCRUSADE, HE SOLD HIS EXPENSIVE CARS AND MOST OF HIS OTHER PROPERTY . "I WORKED LIKE MAD, LIVING AND SLEEPING ON TRAINS, " SAYS THE TUNKU . "I WAS OFTEN HOME ONLY ONE DAY A MONTH . " BUT ABDUL RAHMAN'S ZEAL PAIDOFF . IN THE 1955 GENERAL ELECTION, THE ALLIANCE SWEPT 51 OF THE 52SEATS IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE, AND THE TUNKU TOOK OVER AS CHIEFMINISTER UNDER THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER . MERDEKA . ABDUL RAHMANWAS SO BUSY POLITICKING THAT HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE MILITARY INTEREST INTHE BRUTAL, BLOODY GUERRILLA WAR THAT 350,000 BRITISH AND MALAYANTROOPS AND HOME GUARDSMEN WERE WAGING AGAINST COMMUNIST INSURGENTS INMALAYA'S TANGLED JUNGLES . BUT AFTER HIS 1955 ELECTION LANDSLIDE, THETUNKU GREW AFRAID THAT THE BRITISH MIGHT USE THE EMERGENCY TO DELAYINDEPENDENCE, ARRANGED TO MEET THE COMMUNIST REBEL CHIEFTAINS INNORTHERN MALAYA TO SEE IF SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT ./ MY IDEAS ABOUT COMMUNISM WERE DETERMINED BY THAT MEETING, " SAYS THETUNKU . " I BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONCE A COMMUNIST, ALWAYS A COMMUNIST. THEY COULD NEVER COEXIST WITH US IN AN INDEPENDENT MALAYA . /AS THE WAR IN THE JUNGLE BEGAN TAKING ATURN FOR THE BETTER, ABDUL RAHMAN FLINTILY TOLD BRITAIN THAT THE TIMEWAS LONG OVERDUE FOR MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . AFTER MONTHS OF HAGGLINGAND DELAY, THE TUNKU FINALLY FORCED BRITAIN'S COLONIAL SECRETARY ALANLENNOX-BOYD (NOW LORD BOYD) TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE . THROUGHOUT THEGRUELING, THREE-WEEK SESSION IN LONDON, THE TUNKU REFUSED TO BUDGE FROMHIS ULTIMATUM THAT INDEPENDENCE MUST COME NO LATER THAN AUG . 31, 1957. " WHEN THE SIAMESE HAVE NO INTENTION OF YIELDING, THEY JUST APPEARSTUPID, " HE TOLD SUBORDINATES . " I'M HALF SIAMESE, YOU KNOW . " ATLAST, LENNOX-BOYD GOT THE POINT AND CAVED IN . ON THE TUNKU'S TARGETDATE, INDEPENDENT MALAYA AT LAST CAME INTO BEING . " GOOD OLD TUNKU . "THE TUNKU HAD NO REVOLUTIONARY BLUEPRINT FOR HIS NEW NATION, BROUGHTINTO HIS CABINET HIS OLD LONDON CRONY, ABDUL RAZAK, TO HAMMER OUT APROGRAM FOR ORDERLY PROGRESS . WHILE ABDUL RAHMAN GROUND DOWN HARD ONRED SUBVERSIVES, MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT RAZAK (IN THE POST HEWILL RETAIN IN MALAYSIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT) STARTED A PROGRAM OF NEWROADS, SCHOOLS AND CLINICS TO BOOST THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THEPRIMITIVE KAMPONGS (VILLAGES), WHERE THE COMMUNISTS WERE TRYING TO GAINA FOOTHOLD . IN THE AIR-CONDITIONED " OPERATIONS ROOM " OF HISMINISTRY, GADGET-LOVING RAZAK CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HISBULLDOZERS ON DOZENS OF CHARTS, MOVIE SCREENS AND MAP DISPLAYS, KEPTHIS PROGRAM CONSTANTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH HIS COLD INSISTENCE ONRESULTS OR ELSE . ABDUL RAHMAN MADE NO EFFORT TO SQUEEZE THE BRITISHOUT OF THE COUNTRY, WAS CONVINCED THAT THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC ANDMILITARY PRESENCE OF THE BRITISH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE INSURANCE FORMALAYAN STABILITY . TODAY A BRITISH OFFICER COMMANDS THE MALAYAN ARMY,FIVE SENIOR BRITISH CIVIL SERVANTS HOLD KEY POSITIONS IN MALAYANGOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, AND BRITISH BUSINESSMEN CONTROL MORE THAN HALFOF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY, REPATRIATE $86 MILLION IN PROFITS ANNUALLY . "IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS PLACE HAS FLOWERED SINCE INDEPENDENCE, " SAYSONE BUSINESSMAN . " WE'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER OFF . GOOD OLD TUNKU . "PARLEYS ON THE GREEN . WITH HIS YOUNG NATION BOOMING, ABDUL RAHMANLOOKED WITH INCREASING FEAR AT THE PREDICAMENT OF NEIGHBORINGSINGAPORE, JUST THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE ACROSS THE JOHORE STRAIT .THERE COMMUNISM WAS SPREADING LIKE AN INFECTION AMONG THE UNDERFED,UNDEREMPLOYED MASSES IN SINGAPORE'S SQUALID, TEEMING TENEMENT QUARTERS. BY STRIKES, RIOTS AND BOYCOTTS, THE PEKING-ORIENTED, COMMUNIST-FRONTBARISAN SOCIALIST PARTY TRIED TO TOPPLE THE TOTTERING GOVERNMENT GLUEDTOGETHER BY SINGAPORE'S SHIFTY, BRILLIANT, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED PRIMEMINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, 39 . NEVER TOO CHOOSY ABOUT WHERE HE GOTPOLITICAL SUPPORT, " HARRY " LEE FIRST TRIED COOPERATION WITH THECOMMUNISTS, LATER ADOPTED A " LEFTIST, NOT EXTREMIST, NONCOMMUNIST, NOTANTI-COMMUNIST " POLICY . IT DID NOT WORK ,SAVE HIS POLITICAL NECK, HEWAS FORCED TO GO FOR HELP TO AN OLD GOLFING PARTNER ABDUL RAHMAN .LEE'S VACATION HOUSE BORDERED A FAIRWAY OF KUALA KUMPUR'S RAMBLINGSELANGOR GOLF CLUB, WHERE THE TUNKU SHOT HIS DAILY ROUND . FROM TEE TOGREEN, LEE TRIED TO CONVINCE ABDUL RAHMAN THAT SINGAPORE'S RICKETYCOALITION COULD NEVER SURVIVE ANOTHER ELECTION, AND THAT A REDSINGAPORE COULD ONLY SPELL TROUBLE FOR MALAYA . GRADUALLY, THE TUNKUCAME TO THE FRIGHTENING CONCLUSION THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT WELL BECOME " ACHINESE CUBA . " ONE SOLUTION TO THE " SINGAPORE PROBLEM " WAS OBVIOUS: A MERGER, SO THAT MALAYA'S POWERFUL INTERNAL SECURITY POLICE COULDMOVE IN AND HELP SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES HOLD RED SUBVERSION IN CHECK .BUT THE TUNKU SHUDDERED AT THE PROSPECT OF UPSETTING HIS NATION'S MALAYRACIAL PREPONDERANCE BY THE ADDITION OF SINGAPORE'S 1,300,000 CHINESE ./ IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE POPULATION, " HE SAYS, " I THOUGHT OF THEBORNEO TERRITORIES . /WINING & DINING . SARAWAK, BRUNEI ANDNORTH BORNEO, HOWEVER, WERE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE FEDERATIONSCHEME . BORNEO LEADERS RESENTED BEING INVITED TO JOIN MERELY AS APOLITICAL AND RACIAL ACCOMMODATION, DESIRED INSTEAD SOME SORT OFINDEPENDENCE OF THEIR OWN . THEN BRITAIN BEGAN PUTTING QUIET PRESSUREON THE THREE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNIONIN MALAYSIA OFFERED THEM FAR MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER THANTHEY COULD EVER ACHIEVE BY THEMSELVES . BUT IT WAS ABDUL RAHMAN WHOSOLD THE SCHEME . THE TUNKU WINED AND DINED A CONTINUOUS STREAM OFBORNEO DELEGATIONS IN KUALA LUMPUR, WARMED UP BORNEO LEADERS COOL TOTHE FEDERATION WITH PROMISES OF FAVORED POLITICAL POSITIONS IN THE NEWNATION . HE SHREWDLY OFFERED THE BORNEO TERRITORIES 70 SEATS IN THEFEDERAL PARLIAMENT, AGAINST ONLY 15 FOR FAR MORE POPULOUS SINGAPORE AND104 FOR MALAYA . HE PROMISED TAX CONCESSIONS AND A $12 MILLION DOLLOPOF MALAYAN AID ANNUALLY TO THE TERRITORIES, AGREED TO KEEP FEDERALHANDS OFF BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES . IT WAS THE TUNKU'S FONDEST HOPE THATTHE NEW NATION COME INTO BEING ON AUG . 31, 1963, THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARYOF MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . THEN LAST DECEMBER CAME A BLOW THATTHREATENED TO DESTROY THE TUNKU'S TIMETABLE . IT WAS THE UPRISING INBRUNEI . " JUST TOO MUCH . " DISCONTENT WITH THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI'SCORRUPT, INEFFICIENT AND AUTOCRATIC REGIME HAD LONG BEEN FESTERING INTHE TINY, DELAWARE-SIZED TERRITORY . LAST YEAR THE SULTAN'S GOVERNMENTSPENT ONLY $50,000 ON DRUGS AND MEDICINE FOR ITS PEOPLE, WHILE LAYINGOUT $47,000 FOR ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION ON THE SULTAN'S BIRTHDAY ACTIONON REQUESTS TO THE GOVERNMENT USUALLY TOOK FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREEYEARS . THE DOMINANT BUT POWERLESS PEOPLE'S PARTY WAS ALSO DEAD-SETAGAINST MALAYSIA ; THE PARTY'S ERRATIC, GOATEED ONETIME VETERINARIANLEADER, SHEIK A . M . AZAHARI, 34, WANTED INSTEAD TO ALIGN BRUNEI,SARAWAK AND NORTH BORNEO INTO A SINGLE INDEPENDENT STATE WITH HIMSELFAS ITS LEADER . WHEN IT FINALLY ERUPTED, THE REVOLT WAS POORLYORGANIZED AND BADLY LED . FOUR BATTALIONS OF BRITAIN'S TOUGH LITTLEGURKHA TROOPS LANDED ON BRUNEI, INSIDE OF A WEEK SENT THE SHATTEREDREMNANTS OF THE 3,000MAN REBEL ARMY SCUTTLING BACK INTO HIDING INBRUNEI'S STEAMING JUNGLES . BUT THE BRUNEI REVOLT AT LAST GAVE THEPHILIPPINES AND INDONESIA, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AN EXCUSE TO DISPLAYTHEIR OPPOSITION TO THE SCHEME . OBLIVIOUS TO MALAYA'S SUCCESS AGAINSTRED INFILTRATION, THE PHILIPPINES FEARED THAT LEFTISTS WOULD ULTIMATELYTAKE OVER THE NEW NATION, THUS PUTTING A CUMMUNIST NEIGHBOR RIGHT ONTHEIR DOORSTEP . DUSTING OFF AN OLD CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, THEPHILIPPINES MAINTAINED THAT IN 1878 THE SULTAN OF SULU HAD ONLY "LEASED, " NOT SOLD, THE TERRITORY TO THE BRITISH . LONDON STIFFLYREJECTED THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO THE REGION .INDONESIA SHOUTED THAT THE TURMOILSHOWED THE DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH MALAYSIA IN THE BORNEOTERRITORIES, AND THAT THE FEDERATION WAS ONLY A PLOT TO EXTENDBRITAIN'S COLONIAL INFLUENCE IN ASIA . RABBLE-ROUSING PRESIDENT SUKARNOKNEW THAT A BRITISH-BACKED, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MALAYSIA WOULD NOT ONLYDERAIL HIS AMBITION TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE BORNEOTERRITORIES, BUT MIGHT ALSO SERVE AS AN INDUCEMENT TO REBELLION FOR THEPEOPLE OF DEPRESSED INDONESIAN BORNEO . MOREOVER, ABDUL RAHMAN HASIGNORED EVERY " REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE " FOR WHICH SUKARNO STANDS, HASIN THE PROCESS CREATED A CONSERVATIVE, PROSPEROUS NATION, WHILEREVOLUTIONARY, LEFTIST INDONESIA, WITH ITS 100 MILLION PEOPLE, HAS SLIDTO THE EDGE OF ECONOMIC RUIN . SAYS A DIPLOMAT :. " TO HAVE A LITTLECOUNTRY LIKE THIS EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS JUSTTOO MUCH FOR SUKARNO . " SOUND GROUND . IN A DRUMFIRE OF PROPAGANDAOUTBURSTS, INDONESIA HAILED THE " BRUNEI FREEDOM FIGHTERS, " LASHED OUTAT " BRITISH MERCENARIES AND PUPPETS, " GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM TOBRUNEI LEADER AZAHARI, RAVED THAT ABDUL RAHMAN WAS " ROUND THE BEND . "(RETORTED THE TUNKU : " WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A PIG BUT A GRUNT ?/ ) DJAKARTA MOBS HANGED THE TUNKU IN EFFIGY, AND SUKARNO DECLARED A "POLICY OF CONFRONTATION " AGAINST MALAYA . INDONESIAN JETS BUZZEDMALAYAN SHIPS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND ARMY LEADERS DARKLYTHREATENED " INCIDENTS OF PHYSICAL CONFLICT " ALONG THE BORDER OFBRUNEI AND INDONESIA . SUKARNO DID NOT DARE TO INVADE ; HE PLAINLYHOPED TO INDUCE THE UNITED NATIONS TO STEP IN AND PLACATE HIM AS IT DIDWITH WEST NEW GUINEA THUS SPARING HIM THE NECESSITY OF FIGHTING FORWHAT HE WANTS . HOWEVER, THE U.N . SEEMS UNWILLING TO PLAY SUKARNO'SGAME ; A U.N . OBSERVER TEAM TOLD HIM THAT MALAYSIA IS " ON SOUNDLEGAL GROUND . " PROMISE TO " BROTHERS . " LAST WEEK IN MANILA, THEACRID DISPUTE BETWEEN INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND MALAYSIA ADDED ANUNDERTONE OF TENSION TO THE OTHERWISE CALM MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATIONOF SOUTHEAST ASIA . NOT ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA, THE MALAYSIA QUESTIONCAME UP REPEATEDLY IN LONG PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ABDUL RAHMAN ANDPHILIPPINES PRESIDENT DIOSDADO MACAPAGAL . THE TUNKU WAS ANXIOUS FORTHE WHOLE MATTER TO BE SETTLED QUIETLY . IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE REASONABLEAND FRIENDLY WITH HIS " MALAY BROTHERS, " HE AGREED TO LOOK INTO THEFILIPINO CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, LUKEWARMLY ENDORSED A PROPOSAL FOR ANASIAN SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF, MACAPAGAL, AND INDONESIA'SSUKARNO . BUT THE TUNKU VETOED THE SUGGESTION THAT HE POSTPONE THECREATION OF MALAYSIA UNTIL SOME SETTLEMENT COULD BE REACHED ; THEFEDERATION, HE SAID, WOULD COME INTO BEING BY AUG . 31 AS PLANNED .FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LANGUAGE, RELIGION, CULTURE OR GEOGRAPHY,MALAYSIA IS NOT A NATURAL NATION . BUT ABDUL RAHMAN HAS FACED PROBLEMSSIMILAR TO MALAYSIA'S IN HIS OWN MALAYA AND THERE A DECENT SOCIETY HASFLOURISHED . HE DOES NOT PROMISE THE MOON TO HIS NEW NATION, ONLY ASANE, HUMANE, WORKABLE GOVERNMENT . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, MALAYSIA CANBE, AS JOHN F . KENNEDY HAS SAID, " THE BEST HOPE OF SECURITY IN THATVITAL PART OF THE WORLD . /
