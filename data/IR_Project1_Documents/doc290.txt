WHAT THEYARE FIGHTING ABOUTAT ITS SIMPLEST,THE RUSSIAN-CHINESE QUARREL IS OVER WHAT STRATEGY TO FOLLOW TOWARD THEULTIMATE VICTORY OF COMMUNISM AND OVER WHO SHALL BE IN CHARGE OFOPERATIONS . BUT BENEATH THIS THERE LIES A FAR DEEPER SPLIT : THESPLIT BETWEEN COMMUNIST THEORY AND HUMAN REALITY . EVER SINCE KARL MARXPREDICTED THAT THE REVOLUTION WOULD BREAK OUT IN INDUSTRIALLY ADVANCEDWESTERN EUROPE, WHILE IT ACTUALLY CAME IN BACKWARD, AGRICULTURALRUSSIA, SUCH CONTRADICTIONS HAVE HAUNTED COMMUNISM . TODAY, ACCORDINGTO MARXIST THEORY, CAPITALISM SHOULD BE IN ITS DEATH THROES, THEWORKING CLASS IN UTTER MISERY, AND THE FORMER COLONIAL PEOPLES WELL ONTHE ROAD TO COMMUNISM . INSTEAD, CAPITALISM IS THRIVING, WESTERNWORKERS ARE GOING MIDDLE-CLASS, AND THE EX-COLONIES TEND TOWARDSOCIALISM BUT HARDLY TOWARD COMMUNISM . NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV FAVORSCHANGING THE THEORY TO FIT THESE FACTS MORE CLOSELY ; HE IS, AS PEKINGACCURATELY CHARGES, A REVISIONIST . MAO TSE-TUNG FAVORS CHANGING THEFACTS TO FIT THE THEORY ; HE IS, AS MOSCOW SAYS, A DOGMATIST . BUTBOTH ARE ALSO REALISTS, MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT NATIONAL INTERESTS,DIFFERENT ECONOMIES, AND DIFFERENT HISTORIES . KHRUSHCHEV, THE RULER OFA NATION THAT HAS AT LAST BEGUN TO GAIN SOME MATERIAL REWARDS, ARGUESTHAT PEOPLE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WAR OR REVOLUTION BUT IN PEACEFULPROSPERITY, AND THAT ROCKETRATTLING WILL ONLY DRIVE MILLIONS AWAY FROMCOMMUNISM . MAO, RULER OF A COUNTRY WITH A LOT LESS TO LOSE, MASTER OFA PEASANTRY WHOSE APPETITES DEMAND A BOWL OF RICE, NOT A TV SET OR ACAR, REPLIES IN EFFECT THAT HE IS NOT RUNNING A POPULARITY CONTEST WITHTHE WEST . POWER CANNOT BE WON BY WOOING ADHERENTS BUT BY FIGHTING FORIT OTHERWISE COMMUNISM WILL ATROPHY . FROM THE GOLDEN HORDE TO YENANMARXISM PRETENDS THAT IT RAISES PEOPLE ABOVE RACE AND NATION, BUTMOSCOW AND PEKING ARE DIVIDED BY RACIAL HOSTILITY AND MEMORIES OFCONFLICT, WHICH WOULD PERSIST EVEN IF IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES COULD BEIRONED OUT . RUSSIA HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THE GOLDEN HORDE OF GENGHISKHAN, WHICH SWEPT WEST FROM MONGOLIA IN THE 13TH CENTURY, CONSCRIPTINGVOLGA BOATMEN INTO THE KHAN'S ARMY AND FORCING LOCAL PRINCES TO KOWTOW.WHEN, AFTER 200 YEARS, THE MONGOL EMPIRE COLLAPSED, THE NEWLY UNITEDRUSSIANS LOST NO TIME IN GETTING EVEN . " WEHRE IS CHINA ? " ASKEDCZAR MIKHAIL ROMANOV . " IS IT RICH ? WHAT CAN WE LAY CLAIM TO ? "RUSSIAN CLAIMS (MANCHURIA, OUTER MONGOLIA, SINKIANG) CAUSED FRICTIONFOR CENTURIES, DOWN TO THE PRESENT . AS LATE AS 1949, WHEN THE CHINESEREDS HAD VIRTUALLY CONQUERED THE MAINLAND FROM THE NATIONALISTS, MOSCOWWAS STILL DICKERING FOR TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS . THE CHINESE STILLSNEER AT THE RUSSIANS AS " BIG NOSES " AND CONSIDER THEM AS ALIEN ASOTHER WESTERNERS . MOREOVER, THE POPULATION PRESSURE ALONG THESINO-SOVIET BORDER IS A CONSTANT MENACE TO MOSCOW ; BY 1980 THERE WILLBE 1 BILLION CHINESE . WHEN A BRITISH VISITOR SUGGESTED TO KHRUSHCHEVNOT LONG AGO THAT THE CHINESE MASSES WOULD EVENTUALLY EXPLODE NORTHINTO SIBERIA OR SOUTH TO AUSTRALIA, NIKITA REPLIED GRIMLY : " I'M INFAVOR OF AUSTRALIA . " FROM THE START, RUSSIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS ALSOSHAPED MOSCOW'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS . IN THE 1920S,STALIN RUTHLESSLY SACRIFICED MAO'S COMMUNIST MOVEMENT TO CHIANGKAISHEK, WHOM HE SUPPORTED BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED HIM A STRONG SOVIETALLY WHO WOULD FIGHT BOTH WESTERN AND JAPANESE THREATS TO RUSSIAN POWER.DECIMATED BY CHIANG, THE RAGGED CHINESE COMMUNISTS SURVIVED IN THECAVES OF YENAN AND EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO CONQUER CHINA, DESPITESTALIN'S WARNING THAT THEY WERE BACKWARD AND NOT READY FOR REVOLUTION .AFTER THE WAR, STALIN SENT MAO A RUSSIAN HANDBOOK OF PARTISAN STRATEGYAGAINST THE NAZIS ; MAO PASSED IT TO AN AIDE WHO SNORTED : " IF WEHAD THIS AS OUR TEXTBOOK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED TEN YEARS AGO .THUS MAO WAS BEHOLDENNO ONE, LEAST OF ALL STALIN, FOR HIS VICTORY . YET IRONICALLY, THEFIRST OPEN IDEOLOGICAL CRACK IN THE MOSCOW-PEKING PARTNERSHIP CAME OVERKHRUSHCHEV'S 1956 DENUNCIATION OF STALIN . FROM " SECRET SPEECH " TOSPUTNIK MAO HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS LAVISHLYPRAISING THE DEAD DICTATOR . WITHOUT BOTHERING TO CONSULT THE CHINESE,KHRUSHCHEV DELIVERED HIS FAMED " SECRET SPEECH " TO THE CONGRESS, INWHICH HE SUDDENLY UNMASKED STALIN AS A MEGALOMANICAL TYRANT . PEKINGWAS STUNNED . MAO FELT CORRECTLY, AS WAS PROVED A FEW MONTHS LATER BYTHE UPRISINGS IN POLAND AND HUNGARY THAT THE DESTALINIZATION DRIVEWOULD TOUCH OFF A WAVE OF UNREST . EVEN THOUGH STALIN HAD BULLIED ANDBETRAYED THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS (AS WELL AS HELPED THEM, AT A PRICE,DURING THE KOREAN WAR), MAO BELIEVED IN STALIN'S PRINCIPLE OFCENTRALIZED RULE, PREFERRED A STABLE RED EMPIRE TO ONE IN FERMENT . THECHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE HASTILY CALLED A SECRETSESSION ; A MONTH LATER, RED CHINA DEFIANTLY ANNOUNCED THAT, DESPITEWHAT THE KREMLIN HAD TO SAY, STALIN'S ACHIEVEMENTS OUTWEIGHED HISERRORS . ON FOREIGN POLICY PEKING AGREED FOR THE MOMENT TO BACKKHRUSHCHEV'S TALK OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH THE WEST, SINCE MAOHIMSELF WAS THEN ENERGETICALLY PUSHING THE " BANDUNG SPIRIT " OF SWEETNEIGHBORLINESS IN ASIA . EVEN THIS QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR THE KREMLINDISAPPEARED WHEN, IN AUGUST 1957, THE SOVIET UNION TEST-FIRED ITS FIRSTICBM AND TWO MONTHS LATER LAUNCHED SPUTNIK . RUSSIAN ROCKETRY, PEKINGDECIDED, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY GAVE THE COMMUNIST CAMP MILITARYSUPERIORITY OVER THE WEST ; THE REDS MUST NOW SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE BYFOMENTING REVOLUTIONS IN UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS, EVEN AT THE RISK OFWAR . INSTEAD, KHRUSHCHEV PURSUED A DETENTE WITH THE WEST . IN 1958 HEAGREED TO A MORATORIUM ON NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE ATMOSPHERE (BROKEN IN1961), PARTLY DESIGNED TO FREEZE OUT PEKING AS AN ATOMIC POWER . WHENTHE CHINESE WANTED RUSSIAN ATOMIC COVER FOR A MOVE AGAINST THE OFFSHOREISLANDS AND FORMOSA, MOSCOW REFUSED . FROM GREAT LEAP TO GREAT BRAWLMEANWHILE, THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEM EAGER TO HELP THEIR CHINESEBROTHERS WITH THEIR GROWING INTERNAL ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES . WHILEKHRUSHCHEV WOOED NEUTRALIST INDIA AND EGYPT WITH AID, AND EVEN BROUGHTHIS MONEYBAGS ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THAT RENEGADE RED, TITO, NOT ANADDITIONAL RUBLE WAS ALLOTTED TO MAO . THE RED CHINESE USED THE ONLYSURPLUS RAW MATERIAL AT THEIR COMMAND : PEOPLE . MILLIONS OF PEASANTSWERE HERDED INTO PEOPLE'S COMMUNES AND HITCHED TO PLOWS . PEKING BROKEUP FAMILIES, TRIED TO BAN MONEY, JERRY-BUILT HUNDREDS OF " BACKYARD "STEEL FURNACES . THE SLOGAN WAS : " COMMUNISM CAN GROW GRAIN AND MAKESTEEL . " THROUGH BRAWN AND " REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICISM " CHINA WAS TOTURN ALMOST OVERNIGHT INTO AN INDUSTRIALIZED LAND . THE GREAT LEAPFORWARD WAS HAILED AS A SHORT CUT TO COMMUNISM AND A SLAP AT MOSCOW .KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE . AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEEXPERIMENT INDEED COLLAPSED . GLOATING OVER THE FAILURE, KHRUSHCHEVTOLD VISITING HUBERT HUMPHREY THAT MAO'S IDEA HAD BEEN FOOLISHLY "UTOPIAN . " BY THE TIME NIKITA SHOWED UP IN PEKING IN 1959, FRESH FROMHIS TOUR OF THE U.S . AND THE MEETING WITH IKE AT CAMP DAVID, HE WASBARELY ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH HIS HOSTS . THE AIRPORT WAS DECORATEDWITH HUGE POSTERS OF STALIN ; ON THE WAY TO TOWN, KHRUSHCHEV AND MAOBEGAN AN ARGUMENT THAT LASTED FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS . WHEN THE SOVIETRULER LEFT, NOT EVEN THE NICETIES OF A FORMAL COMMUNIQUE WERE OBSERVED.BY EARLY 1960 MAO HAD CLEARLYGIVEN UP HOPE OF PERSUADING KHRUSHCHEV TO CHANGE HIS FLEXIBLE COLD WARPOLICY, AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT CHINESE OFFENSIVE DESIGNED TO TOPPLEKHRUSHCHEV FROM POWER . IT WAS ALSO THE START OF AN ENDLESS ARGUMENTABOUT WHETHER AUTHORITY FOR MOSCOW'S " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " ORPEKING'S " INEVITABILITY OF WAR " COULD BE FOUND IN THE SACRED LENINTEXTS . ACTUALLY LENIN, AND EVEN STALIN, HAD ARGUED BOTH WAYS ATVARIOUS TIMES, DEPENDING ON CONDITIONS AND MOSCOW POINTED OUT THATCONDITIONS WERE CERTAINLY DIFFERENT IN THE NUCLEAR AGE . WHEN MAO'S MENCARRIED THE ATTACK INTO A MEETING OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS INBUCHAREST IN JUNE, KHRUSHCHEV WAS INCENSED . " ONE CANNOT MECHANICALLYREPEAT WHAT LENIN SAID DECADES AGO, " HE SHOUTED . " WE LIVE IN A TIMEWHEN NEITHER MARX NOR ENGELS NOR LENIN IS WITH US . IF WE ACT LIKECHILDREN WHO STUDY THE ALPHABET BY BUILDING WORDS OUT OF LETTERS, WESHALL NOT GET VERY FAR . " A FULL-DRESS SUMMIT SESSION OF 81 COMMUNISTPARTIES IN MOSCOW IN NOVEMBER 1960 PRODUCED A STATEMENT (ADOPTEDUNANIMOUSLY, OF COURSE) THAT MERELY LUMPED TOGETHER THESE DIAMETRICALLYOPPOSED OPINIONS . THEN LAST FALL, THE RED CHINESE INVASION OF INDIAONLY SERVED TO JUSTIFY KHRUSHCHEV'S VIEW THAT MAO WAS A RECKLESSFANATIC, AND MOSCOW OSTENTATIOUSLY FAILED TO BACK PEKING . AS FORKHRUSHCHEV'S WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET MISSILES FROM CUBA, THE MANEUVERCONFIRMED MAO'S WORST FEARS ABOUT VACILLATING KREMLIN LEADERSHIP,LEANING FIRST TO " ADVENTURISM, " THEN TO " CAPITULATIONISM . "THUNDERED PEKING : " IT IS 100 PER CENT APPEASEMENT . A MUNICH PUREAND SIMPLE . IMPERIALISM IS ONLY A PAPER TIGER . " TO WHICH KHRUSHCHEVREPLIED : " THE PAPER TIGER HAS NUCLEAR TEETH . ONLY A MADMAN WOULDSPEAK OF A NEW WORLD WAR . " AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE ARGUMENTSTILL STANDS . FROM VISION TO DANGER TIME WAS WHEN WESTERN SKEPTICSWONDERED WHETHER THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT WAS REAL . KHRUSHCHEV, THEYFIGURED, MIGHT BE RELATIVELY NICE TO THE WEST ONLY LONG ENOUGH TOWANGLE SOME CONCESSIONS ON NATO OR NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL ; THEN MAOWOULD STEP IN AND TOGETHER THEY WOULD DEMOLISH THE FREE WORLD . TODAYIT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE QUARREL IS MERELY AN ACT . IN FACT, THEREIS A GROWING VISION SHARED BY SUCH DISPARATE PROPHETS AS ARNOLD TOYNBEEAND CHARLES DE GAULLE OF RUSSIA AND THE WEST SOME DAY STANDING TOGETHERAS ALLIES AGAINST CHINA . STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN HISTORY .YET THE VISION HAS ITS DANGERS . THE WEST HAS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLYMOVED INTO A NEW ERA OF SOFTNESS TOWARD COMMUNISM . FEW ANY LONGER TALKOF DEFEATING COMMUNISM ; COEXISTENCE IS MORE OR LESS ACCEPTED IN THEWEST . THIS MAY BE ONLY REALISTIC IN THE NUCLEAR AGE . BUT ALL OVER THEWEST THERE IS A CREEPING NOTION THAT KHRUSHCHEV'S KIND OF COMMUNISM CANBE LIVED WITH THAT ONLY PEKING'S IS REALLY BAD AND THIS HAS TAKEN MUCHSTEAM OUT OF THE ANTI-COMMUNIST POSITION . NIKITA'S " REASONABLE "APPROACH HAS HELPED THE ITALIAN REDS GAIN STRENGTH, HAS REVIVED DREAMSOF A NEW POPULAR FRONT AMONG ONCE SOLIDLY ANTI-COMMUNIST FRENCHSOCIALISTS, HAS EVEN PROMPTED BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER PAUL HENRI SPAAKTO SAY THAT THE REMOVAL OF U.S . NUCLEAR STOCKPILES FROM WESTERN EUROPEMIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA AFTER ALL . THESE ARE ONLY MODEST REDGAINS . BUT KHRUSHCHEV CAN POINT TO THEM TO ARGUE PLAUSIBLY THAT HE ISNOT NEARLY SO BAD A COMMUNIST STRATEGIST AS PEKING MAKES HIM OUT TO BE
