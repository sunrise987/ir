SOUTH KOREA OVER TO YOU, GENTLEMEN TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES,SOUTH KOREA'S RULING MILITARY JUNTA HAS WIELDED IRON-FISTED CONTROLOVER THE COUNTRY SINCE IT SEIZED POWER IN A LIGHTNING COUP NEARLY TWOYEARS AGO . UNDER STRONGMAN GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, THE GOVERNMENTSTIFLED ALL OPPOSITION ; NEWSPAPERS WERE GAGGED, AND 4,000 KNOWNPOLITICAL OPPONENTS OF THE REGIME WERE FORBIDDEN TO CRITICIZE IT INPUBLIC . BUT PARK HAS BEEN LESS SUCCESSFUL IN QUELLING DISAFFECTIONWITHIN HIS OWN JUNTA . LAST WEEK THE WRANGLING WAS OUT IN THE OPEN,THREATENING TO PLUNGE SOUTH KOREA INTO YET ANOTHER FULL-SCALECRISIS . SNOOPER BOSS . PARK'S GENERALS BECAME OPENLY RESTIVE SOONAFTER HIS DECISION TO RESTORE CIVILIAN POLITICAL RULE (TIME, DEC . 28),AT LEAST IN NAME . IN FACT, JUNTA MEMBERS PLANNED MERELY TO SWAP THEIRKHAKI FOR MUFTI AND CONTINUE TO RUN THE COUNTRY ; PARK HIMSELF WAS THELEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY . THIS PLEASANT PROSPECT WASSHATTERED LAST JANUARY WHEN BRIGADIER GENERAL KIM CHONG PIL, HUSBAND OFPARK'S NIECE AND BOSS OF THE DREADED CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, QUITTHE C.I.A .  IN ORDER TO GRAB CONTROL OF THE REGIME'S CIVILIANPOLITICAL ORGANIZATION, THE DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH PARK'STACIT APPROVAL KIM WHOSE 30,000 SNOOPERS HAD KEPT  TABS ON ANYTHINGAND ANYONE THE JUNTA MIGHT DISTRUST INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE JUNTAINFILTRATED THE PARTY'S POWER POSITIONS WITH 1,200 OF HIS FORMER C.I.AAGENTS., JUNTA MEMBERS OBJECTED TO KIM'S POWER GRAB AS A BLATANTATTEMPT TO CUT THEM OUT OF THE LION'S SHARE OF THE SPOILS . WHEN THEYINSISTED THAT PARK FIRE KIM FROM THE PARTY LEADERSHIP, PARK RETALIATEDBY SACKING FOUR OF KIM'S BITTEREST FOES FROM THE JUNTA . BUT THE FOUR,ALL HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS, THREATENED TO PLUNGE SOUTH KOREA INTO CIVILWAR UNLESS PARK BROUGHT KIM TO HEEL . " THE ENTIRE ARMY IS AGAINST YOU,ONE OFFICER TOLD PARK . " YOU CANNOT WIN . " FAILED OBJECTIVE . PARKFINALLY CAPITULATED . HE FORCED KIM TO RESIGN HIS PARTY POST, LAST WEEKSENT HIM ON A 50-DAY FOREIGN INSPECTION TRIP AS HIS " AMBASSADORPLENIPOTENTIARY . " NO SOONER HAD KIM LEFT THAN INVESTIGATORS BEGANEXPLORING RUMORS THAT HE HAD USED HIS POWERFUL C.I.A . JOB TO MAKE ASTOCK MARKET KILLING AND TO MULCT KICKBACKS FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS. BEFORE 3,000 SCREAMING POLITICIANS IN SEOUL'S CITIZENS HALL, PARKANNOUNCED GRIMLY THAT HE WAS BOWING OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE . " ICANNOT HELP ADMITTING, " HE SAID, " THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENTHAS FAILED COMPLETELY IN ACHIEVING ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVE THEEMERGENCE OF NEW POLITICAL PERSONALITIES . " CERTAINLY, PARK'SWITHDRAWAL AND KIM'S FALL FROM GRACE FAILED TO TURN UP ANY PROMISINGNEW POLITICAL LEADERS THE JUNTA-CONTROLLED DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTYIS IN FLOUNDERING DISARRAY WHILE THE THREE OTHER MAJOR CIVILIAN PARTIESWHICH ARE ALSO RIVEN BY INTERNAL DISSENSION, LACK ANY BROAD BASE OFPOPULAR SUPPORT . THUS, FEW SOUTH KOREANS EXPECT THAT PARK WILL REMAINLONG IN THE WINGS . WITH INFLATION RAMPANT AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT A RECORDHIGH, MANY POLITICIANS SUSPECT THAT PARK IS DELIBERATELY SADDLING THEMWITH CHAOS, THAT IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME, HE MAY ONCE AGAIN " SAVE " THECOUNTRY .
