WAY DOWN SOUTH IN WENCESLAS SQUARE IT WAS ALL RATHER EMBARRASSING. JUST AS RADIO PRAGUE WAS GLEEFULLY REPORTING THE BATTLE INBIRMINGHAM, RACE RIOTS EXPLODED IN THE HEART OF THE COMMUNIST CAPITAL .IT BEGAN AT MIDDAY NEAR THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL JUST OFF ANCIENT WENCESLASSQUARE . TWO FOREIGN STUDENTS ONE FROM AFRICA AND ANOTHER FROM THEMIDDLE EAST WERE OUT FOR A STROLL WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED BY A GANG OF300 CZECHS WHO PUMMELED THEM WITH FISTS AND BUNCHES OF KEYS WHILEPOLICE STOOD IDLY BY . THAT EVENING ANOTHER GROUP OF YOUNG CZECHS BEGANSWINGING AT AN AFRICAN WALKING WITH HIS CZECH WIFE, THEN PICKED A FIGHTWITH TWO MORE AFRICANS WHO HAD BEEN ARGUING WITH SOME CUBANS . THISTIME POLICE BROKE UP THE BRAWLS, BUT NOT BEFORE A FOURTH INCIDENTOCCURRED . AN AFRICAN DIPLOMAT HAD PARKED HIS CAR TO INVESTIGATE THETROUBLE ; HE RETURNED TO DISCOVER THAT ALL FOUR OF HIS TIRES WERESLASHED . FIVE DAYS LATER, WHEN RADIO PRAGUE FINALLY GOT AROUND TOREPORTING THE ANTIAFRICAN OUTBURSTS, THE REGIME GLOSSED OVER THEINCIDENT AS THE WORK OF DRUNKEN HOOLIGANS . IT WAS MORE SERIOUS THANTHAT . FOR MONTHS, CZECHS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT SUBSIDIES TOUNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES, INCLUDING DIRECT OUTLAYS TO SCHOLARSHIPSTUDENTS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S WORSENING LIVINGSTANDARD . AND THE BLACK STUDENTS IN PRAGUE SOMETIMES SEEM TO WALK AWAYWITH THE PRETTIEST GIRLS . THE ARRIVAL OF AFRICANS HAS CREATED RACEPROBLEMS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE COMMUNIST WORLD . THERE WAS TROUBLE INPRAGUE LAST YEAR . AT MOSCOW'S PATRICE LUMUMBA UNIVERSITY, 500 AFRICANSTUDENTS ARE CAREFULLY SEGREGATED FROM RUSSIANS ; THREE MONTHS AGO INSOFIA, 600 CLUB-WIELDING BULGARIAN COPS CRACKED THE SKULLS OF AFRICANSTUDENTS WHO WERE DEMONSTRATING FOR NOTHING MORE THAN THEIR OWN CAMPUSORGANIZATION .
