BUT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEVDEVOTED A TOTAL OF SEVEN HOURS TO A TRAVELING GROUP OF 20 TOP AMERICANEXECUTIVES (PLUS ONE EDUCATOR) AS IF HE FOUND MORE CHALLENGE IN THEIRCOMPANY . ON A EUROPEAN TOUR SPONSORED BY TIME, THE VISITORS FIRSTCALLED ON K . AT THE KREMLIN . IN THE OVAL ROOM, WHERE THE SOVIETCOUNCIL OF MINISTERS USUALLY MEETS, THE CALLERS SAT IN ROWS OF SMALLDESKS WHILE HE ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM BEHIND A HUGE BARRICADE OF ATABLE . HE ASKED THEM TO DROP IN AT HIS ANNIVERSARY RECEPTION THEFOLLOWING DAY, AND THEY IN TURN ASKED HIM TO A PARTY OF THEIR OWN (HEPROMPTLY ACCEPTED) . THROUGHOUT, KHRUSHCHEV PUT ON ONE OF THOSEMARATHON PROPAGANDA PERFORMANCES AT WHICH HE IS BY TURNS HEARTY,EARTHY, FUNNY, MENACING, SEEMINGLY FRANK, AND TOTALLY IMPERVIOUS TOARGUMENT . HE SOUNDED HIS USUAL NOTE OF RITUALISTIC OPTIMISM, VOWEDTHAT IN SEVEN YEARS NO MORE AND NO LESS RUSSIA WILL OVERTAKE THE U.S .ECONOMICALLY . TO HENRY R . ROBERTS, PRESIDENT OF CONNECTICUT GENERALLIFE, " HE ACTED LIKE A CORPORATION PRESIDENT WHO IS IN TROUBLE WITHHIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IS TRYING TO GET OUT OF HIS DILEMMA BYMAKING AGGRESSIVE AND BOASTFUL STATEMENTS .

" AGAIN AND AGAIN HE MADE A PITCH FOR TRADE WITH THE U.S.,REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT THAT THE U.S.'S ALLIES TRADE FAR MORE HEAVILYWITH RUSSIA THAN THE U.S . ITSELF . ACTUALLY, AS THESE BUSINESSMEN WELLKNEW, RUSSIA HAS FEW GOLD RESERVES TO PAY FOR U.S . PRODUCTS AND LITTLEIN THE WAY OF EXPORTABLE GOODS THAT MIGHT INTEREST THE U.S . WHENNATIONAL CASH REGISTER PRESIDENT ROBERT S . OELMAN ASKED WHAT PRODUCTSRUSSIA COULD OFFER, KHRUSHCHEV CITED U.S . TRADE IN MACHINE TOOLS WITHWEST GERMANY . " IF WE HAVE MANAGED TO BUILD A ROCKET NO WORSE THANANYTHING YOU HAVE IN THE U.S., THEN I AM SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILDMACHINE TOOLS IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO ANYTHING THE WEST GERMANS CAN BUILD. " MOVING FROM FOREIGN TRADE TO FOREIGN RELATIONS, KHRUSHCHEV PULLEDOUT ALL THE " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " CLICHES, LOST HIS APLOMB (BUT NOTHIS TEMPER) ONLY WHEN CHAUNCEY W . COOK, PRESIDENT OF GENERAL FOODS,ASKED " WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO BUILD A BERLIN WALL AND SHOOT PEOPLEDOWN IF THEY TRY TO GET OVER ? " / A STATE FRONTIER IS A STATEFRONTIER, " KHRUSHCHEV REPLIED . " AND EVERY STATE, WHENEVER ITSBORDERS ARE VIOLATED, SHOOTS THE VIOLATORS . " / NOT TO KEEP PEOPLE IN,WE DON'T, " SNAPPED COOK . " IN YOUR COUNTRY, CHILDREN ARE KILLED IN ACHURCH FOR THE SOLE REASON THAT THEIR COLOR IS DIFFERENT, " K . SNAPPEDBACK . BEFORE ANYONE COULD MAKE THE OBVIOUS RETORT THAT MURDER AT THEWALL, UNLIKE MURDER IN BIRMINGHAM, IS AN ACT OF THE GOVERNMENTKHRUSHCHEV WAS OFF ON SOMETHING ELSEA NEW WAY TO CHEAT . LOOSENING UP ASIT PROGRESSED, THE INTERVIEW CLOSED IN AN EXCHANGE OF BANTER, WITHKHRUSHCHEV MAINTAINING THAT CAPITALISTS CONTROLLED THE U.S . GOVERNMENT. " WHO WAS MCNAMARA BEFORE HE BECAME SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ? " ASKEDNIKITA . " HE WAS PRESIDENT OF FORD MOTOR, " ANSWERED G . KEITHFUNSTON, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE .

"GENERAL CLAY IS NOW WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS, " SAID AVCO BOARD CHAIRMANKENDRICK R . WILSON JR . " HE'S AN ARMY OFFICER WHO MADE GOOD, " ADDEDFUNSTON . KHRUSHCHEV RAISED A PIOUS EYEBROW : " YOU HAVE 190 MILLIONPEOPLE . WHY DON'T THEY ALL MAKE GOOD ? CERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOTTRESPASSED AGAINST GOD . " TO WILSON'S ASSERTION THAT THE AMERICANPEOPLE, THROUGH THE STOCK MARKET, OWN MUCH OF U.S . BUSINESS,KHRUSHCHEV LAUGHED . " CAPITALISTS ARE VERY ASTUTE TO HAVE THOUGHT THATUP, " HE SAID . " IT'S A NEW WAY TO CHEAT PEOPLE . " HE WENT ON TODESCRIBE THE " PARASITIC " STATE OF CAPITALISM, WHERE THE COUPONCLIPPER " CAN LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY, DRINKING, CAROUSING, OR CHANGINGWIVES, " THEN EASED OFF . " I'M YOUR HOST HERE, " HE CONCLUDED, " SOPLEASE DON'T PUT ME IN THE POSITION OF GOING INTO EACH INDIVIDUAL HEREAND ASKING WHERE HE DIRECTS HIS ACTIVITIES AND SO FORTH, HOW MANY WIVESHE HAS . ONE OF YOUR FELLOW CAPITALISTS ROCKEFELLER IS LOSING INPRESTIGE BECAUSE OF THAT . " A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION . NEXT DAY, THEJOVIAL MOOD CHANGED . AT THE TRADITIONAL RED SQUARE PARADE CELEBRATINGTHE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RUSSIANS DISPLAYED A SQUADRON OFFINNED, 50-FT.-LONG ROCKETS, WHICH THEY INSISTED WERE ANTI-MISSILEMISSILES (THE BIRDS LOOKED MORE LIKE BEEFED-UP VERSIONS OF THE SOVIETSA-2 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILE, AND WESTERN OBSERVERS THOUGHT THAT AT MOSTTHEY COULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE U.S . ARMY'S NIKE ZEUS) . AT THEKREMLIN RECEPTION LATER, KHRUSHCHEV'S TOASTS WERE SO HEARTILYANTI-WESTERN THAT U.S . AMBASSADOR FOY KOHLER FINALLY ASKED : " WHEREIS THE SPIRIT OF MOSCOW ? I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY TOASTS I COULD DRINK TO. " BUT THAT EVENING, WALKING INTO THE BUSINESSMEN'S RECEPTION AT THEHOTEL SOVIETSKAYA (WHICH HAD BEEN REFURBISHED AND RESTAFFED FOR THEVISITORS), HE AGAIN WAS AT HIS MOST AMIABLE . SITTING AT A TABLE,OBLIVIOUS TO THE MASSED DIPLOMATS AND NEWSMEN WHO WERE CROWDING IN TOLISTEN, KHRUSHCHEV SIPPED " THREE-STAR " ARMENIAN BRANDY AS, ONE BYONE, THE AMERICANS WERE GUIDED OVER TO TALK TO HIM . LIKE THE MASTERPOLITICIAN HE IS, K . REMEMBERED NAMES, FACES AND BUSINESS SPECIALTIESFROM THE DAY BEFORE, EVEN TOLD A PRETTY SECRETARY : " YOU WORE A BROWNDRESS YESTERDAY . " HE JOKINGLY HIT UP RUDOLPH PETERSON, PRESIDENT OFCALIFORNIA'S BANK OF AMERICA, FOR A $10 BILLION LOAN, WITH EUGENEBEESLEY, PRESIDENT OF ELI LILLY & CO., KHRUSHCHEV CONTINUED ADISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE U.S.-SOVIET EXCHANGES IN MEDICAL RESEARCH, ANDWHEN HE WAS REMINDED THAT A TEAM OF FOUR U.S . DOCTORS IS IN RUSSIA NOWDOING JUST THAT, NIKITA NODDED . " GOOD, " HE SAID, " AND LET'S GIVETHEM A LAXATIVE IF THEY DO BADLY . " HE EAGERLY DISCUSSEDFOOD-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WITH GENERAL FOODS' COOK,MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMICS WITH AVCO'S WILSON, AND LIQUOR WITH SEAGRAM'SEDGAR M . BRONFMAN ( " OUR VODKA IS BETTER THAN YOUR VODKA " ) . WHENSTOCK EXCHANGE PRESIDENT FUNSTON TURNED UP AT THE TABLE, NIKITAKHRUSHCHEV CHANTED, IN ENGLISH : " WALL STREET ! WALL STREET ! "HE SEEMED TO REGARD THE BUSINESSMEN AS DOERS LIKE HIMSELF, AND ONCETOOK A LEFT-HANDED DIG AT COMMUNIST INEFFICIENCY : " CAPITALISTS KNOWWHAT IS PROFITABLE ; CAPITALISTS ARE NOT SOVIET BUREAUCRATS . " OFTENKHRUSHCHEV RETURNED TO HIS THEME OF TRADE : " REMEMBER, PLEASE, THATYOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE A PROFIT DEALING WITH US . " BUT THE QUESTIONREMAINED : A PROFIT FOR WHOM ? WALL STREET'S FUNSTON, FOR ONE,CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S . SHOULD NOT TRADE WITH RUSSIA, SHOULD DONOTHING TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR THEM . SAID HE, IN WEST BERLIN : " IWENT AWAY WITH A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION . HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOLIE TO YOU AND TO WHOM FACTS MEAN NOTHING .
