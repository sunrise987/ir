WEST GERMANY ALT LANG SYNE BY BUS, AUTOMOBILE AND SPECIAL TRAINS,250,000 GERMANS ORIGINALLY FROM SILESIA POURED INTO COLOGNE LAST WEEK .JAMMING OPEN-AIR RESTAURANTS AND BIERSTUBEN, THEY SWAPPED STORIES WITHOLD FRIENDS OVER RHENISH BEER AND SCHNAPPS BENEATH BANNERS PROCLAIMING/ FOR SILESIA . " THE OCCASION WAS THE REGULAR REUNION OF GERMANSEXPELLED FROM COMMUNIST POLAND AFTER WORLD WAR II . DURING A MAMMOTHRALLY AT FAIRGROUNDS ON THE BANKS OF THE RHINE, THE GEMUTLICH SCENESUDDENLY TURNED INTO A RIOT ; STIRRED UP BY A RABBLE-ROUSINGPOLITICIAN, THE CROWD NEARLY MOBBED A GERMAN TV REPORTER WHO HADSUGGESTED THAT POLAND IS DOING WELL BY THE TERRITORIES SEIZED FROMGERMANY AFTER WORLD WAR II . IN GERMAN POLITICS, IT IS AN ARTICLE OFFAITH THAT THESE TERRITORIES MUST ONE DAY BE LIBERATED AND THAT THEGERMANS DRIVEN FROM THE AREA WILL BE ABLE TO GO HOME . BUT THIS BELIEF,WHILE STEADFASTLY MAINTAINED IN PUBLIC, IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOLLOW. FAR MORE REALISTIC THAN LAST WEEK'S MOB SCENE WAS A RARE JOINTAPPEARANCE BY CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER ANDBERLIN'S SOCIALIST MAYOR WILLY BRANDT, BOTH OF WHOM PLEADED FORRECONCILIATION WITH POLAND . THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN STILL BE STIRRED UPBY TALK ABOUT THE " LOST HOMELANDS " IN THE EAST SOMETIMES OBSCURE AMAJOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN WEST GERMANY : THEREMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION INTO THE NATION'S LIFE OF 13 MILLIONREFUGEES, ONEQUARTER OF THE POPULATION . HAPPY MIRACLE . WHEN THEIRTREK TO FREEDOM BEGAN 18 YEARS AGO, FEW THOUGHT THAT QUICK RESETTLEMENTWAS POSSIBLE . IN ONE OF THE WORST FORCED MIGRATIONS OF MODERN TIMES,9,400,000 ETHNIC GERMANS WERE ABRUPTLY EXPELLED FROM COMMUNIST EUROPE,SHOWED UP IN WEST GERMANY IN TATTERED COVERED WAGONS AND WITH EMPTYRUCKSACKS . AFTER THE IRON CURTAIN SNAPPED SHUT, 3,600,000 MORE GERMANSMADE THEIR WAY WEST AND HEIGHTENED THE CRISIS . THE NEW ARRIVALS WEREPENNILESS, HOMELESS AND EMBITTERED . IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTWAR DAYS,WEST GERMANS THEMSELVES WERE NOT MUCH BETTER OFF . THE FIERCECOMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVES AND " ALIENS " FOR JOBS OR EVEN A ROOFCREATED AN EXPLOSIVE CLIMATE OF MUTUAL RECRIMINATION . IT SEEMED AS IFTHE SHAKY NEW DEMOCRACY, DIGGING OUT OF THE WRECKAGE OF HITLER'S REICH,COULD SCARCELY SURVIVE THE HUMAN AVALANCHE . GERMANY'S " ECONOMICMIRACLE " DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE PICTURE . AS THE PACE OF RECOVERYQUICKENED, THOUSANDS OF THE LARGELY AGRICULTURAL IMMIGRANTS WERERETRAINED FOR INDUSTRIAL JOBS, AND BECAME INDISPENSABLE TO THELABOR-SHORT GERMAN ECONOMY . SHARING THE CREDIT FOR THE TOUGHERPOLITICAL MIRACLE OF RESETTLEMENT ARE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC'S TWO MAJORPOLITICAL PARTIES . COMPETING ACTIVELY FOR THE " REFUGEE VOTE, "CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AND SOCIALISTS BACKED A UNIQUE 50 PER CENT TAX ONALL PROPERTY THAT WEST GERMANS HAD MANAGED TO SAVE THROUGH THE WAR, INORDER TO COMPENSATE REFUGEES WHO HAD LOST THEIR POSSESSIONS . A SPECIALEQUALIZATION OF BURDENS BANK GRANTED THOUSANDS OF LOWCREDIT BUSINESSLOANS . SINCE VIRTUALLY ALL WERE HOMELESS, THE EAST GERMANS WERE THECHIEF BENEFICIARIES OF 6,500,000 NEW HOUSING UNITS BUILT SINCE THE WAR. REVEALING SIGN . INEVITABLY, THERE HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTMENTS . ABOUT10 PER CENT OF THE REFUGEES STILL LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING,INCLUDING 700 SILESIAN AND SUDETEN GERMANS WHOSE FLOWERPOTS ANDTELEVISION ANTENNAS EERILY SPROUT FROM THE RECONVERTED BARRACKS ATDACHAU . MANY STILL FEEL THAT THEY ARE WORSE OFF NOW THAN THEY WERE INTHEIR OLD HOMES . ONLY ONE OUT OF SIX FARMERS TILLS HIS OWN LAND ;WHEN HE DOES, IT IS ON A MUCH SMALLER PLOT THAN HE OWNED IN THE EAST .BUT MOST REFUGEES HAVE GOOD JOBS, AND SOME WHO ARRIVED PENNILESS NOWOWN THRIVING BUSINESSES . THOUSANDS HAVE MARRIED WEST GERMANS ANDRAISED FAMILIES . MAJOR INDICATOR THAT THE ONETIME ALIENS NOW CONSIDERTHEMSELVES REAL WEST GERMANS IS THE COLLAPSE OF THE REFUGEE PARTY,WHICH ONCE HAD 27 SEATS IN THE BUNDESTAG . IT HAS HAD NO NATIONAL VOICESINCE 1957 ; LAST MONTH IN LOWER SAXONY, WHERE REFUGEES COMPRISE ABOUT25 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION, IT POLLED A SCANT 3.7 PER CENT OF THEVOTE DURING STATE ELECTIONS . SAYS HANS KOPLITZ, A SUDETEN GERMAN WHONOW OWNS A PROSPEROUS LAUNDRY AND DRY-CLEANING ESTABLISHMENT IN MUNICH: " MOST, WE PAY LIP SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF RETURNING TO OURHOMELANDS . /
