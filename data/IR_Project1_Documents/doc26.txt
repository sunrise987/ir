MOROCCO DISCARDING THE EGGSHELLS A YOUNG MONARCH IN A SHAKY NEWCOUNTRY CAN DO WORSE THAN CHOOSE CHARLES DE GAULLE AS A MODEL TO RULEBY . MOROCCO'S HASSAN II IS JUST SUCH A KING . LIKE LE GRAND CHARLES,HASSAN CONSIDERS HIMSELF HIS COUNTRY'S INDISPENSABLE MAN, AND HE MAY BERIGHT . LIKE DE GAULLE HE CHOSE THE DEVICE OF A POPULAR REFERENDUM WHENHE DECIDED TO ADOPT A CONSTITUTION (TIME, DEC . 28) ; HIS SMASHINGVICTORY WON HASSAN THE RARE ESTEEM OF HIS IDOL IN PARIS . EMPLOYINGSOME GAULLIST FIRMNESS, HASSAN HAS NOW FIRED THE THREE MEMBERS OF HISCABINET WHO REPRESENTED THE POWERFUL ISTIQLAL PARTY, FILLED THEIR JOBSWITH OFFICIALS STOUTLY LOYAL TO THE THRONE . SINCE ISTIQLAL WAS THEPARTY LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING HASSAN'S SUCCESSFULREFERENDUM, THERE WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT HASSAN WAS A BIT UNGRATEFUL .BUT ISTIQLAL LEADERS WERE PRESSING FOR CLOSE ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATICTIES WITH CAIRO, BASED ON A COMMON ISLAMIC HERITAGE, AND DEMANDING THATHASSAN PURSUE MOROCCO'S CLAIMS TO SPANISH SAHARA, MAURITANIA AND PARTOF ALGERIA'S SAHARA . REFUSING TO SALAAM TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, KINGHASSAN RESISTED, ARGUING THAT THE NATION'S FUTURE LIES LESS WITH THEARAB WORLD THAN WITH FRANCE AND EUROPE'S COMMON MARKET . HE ALSOOPPOSED THE NATIONALISTS' AGITATION ON THE BORDER CLAIMS . SAIDHASSAN'S CLOSEST POLITICAL CONFIDANT, CABINET DIRECTOR AHMED REDAGUEDIRA, AFTER THE PURGE : " THE KING HAD TO GET RID OF THE GRAINS OFSAND WHICH ALWAYS KEPT THE STATE MACHINERY OUT OF ORDER . . . THELEADERS AND PLATFORMS OF THE OLD PARTIES ARE STALE, LIKE EMPTYEGGSHELLS . " IT WAS GAULLIST RHETORIC, AND IT HINTED OF STILL ANOTHERGAULLIST TOUCH . RABAT BUZZED WITH RUMORS THAT HASSAN WAS READY TOORGANIZE HIS OWN POLITICAL MACHINE . ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, THE NAMEFOR THE NEW GROUP WAS ALREADY CHOSEN : UNION FOR NEW ROYALTY U.N.R .THEY ARE THE SAME INITIALS AS THOSE OF CHARLES DE GAULLE'S UNION FORTHE NEW REPUBLIC .
