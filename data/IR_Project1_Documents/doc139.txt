ONTO THE BANDWAGON GAMAL ABDEL NASSER STILL HAD THE MOST POPULARCOMMODITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LURE OF ARAB UNITY . A 14-MAN ALGERIANDELEGATION, HEADED BY DEFENSE MINISTER HOUARI BOUMEDIENNE SHOWED UP INCAIRO TO PAY ITS RESPECTS . " REGARDING ARAB UNITY, " SAID BOUMEDIENNE,/ OUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE CREATION OF SOLID, STRONG AND HEALTHYBASES . THE ARAB PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO ACCEPT ANOTHER SETBACK,ANOTHER LETDOWN . FOR THAT REASON, ALL STEPS TOWARD ARAB UNITY MUST BEABSOLUTELY UNSHAKEABLE . " NASSER AGREED COMPLETELY . " WE REFUSE, IFANYBODY ASKS US, " HE SAID, " TO FORM A NOMINAL UNION FOR OUTWARDAPPEARANCES . " LATER, HE FERVENTLY TOLD A SYRIAN DELEGATION HEADED BYBAATH PARTY LEADERS MICHEL AFLAK AND SALAH EL-BITAR : " WE BELIEVE THETIDE OF REVOLUTIONARY UNION IN THIS GENERATION IS A HISTORICOPPORTUNITY WHICH WILL NOT REPEAT ITSELF . " HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THEBAATHISTS BROADEN THEIR NEW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN POPULAR THATIS, NASSERITE ELEMENTS . " MAN OF CRISES . " HE GOT FAST RESULTS .WITHIN THREE DAYS, PRO-NASSER LIEUT . GENERAL LOUAI ATTASSI WAS NAMEDPRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND, AND THECOUNCIL ITSELF WAS ENLARGED TO ADMIT A NASSERITE MAJORITY . ATTASSIPREDICTED THAT UNION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ WOULD BE ACHIEVED " SHORTLY, "CLAIMING, " THIS TRIPARTITE FEDERATION WILL SPREAD AND SPREAD UNTIL THEENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE PERSIAN GULF ISUNIFIED IN ONE POWERFUL STATE, WEIGHING HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE OF WORLDPOWER . " EVEN ONE OF NASSER'S ENEMIES IN THE ARAB WORLD THE HASHEMITEKINGDOM OF JORDAN SHOWED SIGNS LAST WEEK OF BEING DISCREETLY AVAILABLE. IN HIS STONE BASMAN PALACE IN AMMAN, GUARDED BY CIRCASSIAN TROOPERSIN ASTRAKHAN HATS, JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN DEFTLY SHIFTED PRIME MINISTERS. OUT WENT MUSCULAR WASFI TAL, 43, AN EFFICIENT BUT NASSER-HATINGADMINISTRATOR . IN CAME JORDAN'S " MAN OF CRISES, " FIVE-TIME PRIMEMINISTER SAMIR RIFAI, 62, WHO HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING IN RECENT MONTHS FORMORE DEMOCRACY INSIDE JORDAN AND AN END TO ANTAGONISM AGAINST NASSER .WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? AFTER A LATE NIGHT TALK, KING HUSSEIN ANDRIFAI AGREED ON A NEW GOVERNMENT, LOOKING TOWARD PARLIAMENTARYDEMOCRACY AND HUSSEIN'S EVENTUAL RETIREMENT TO THE FIGUREHEAD ROLE OF ACONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH . THEY EVEN GINGERLY ACCEPTED THE NASSER-BAATHSLOGAN OF " FREEDOM, UNITY, SOCIALISM, " WITH ONLY THE SLIGHT AMENDMENTOF THE FINAL WORD TO READ " A BETTER LIFE . " WHAT WAS STILL UNCERTAINLAST WEEK WAS WHETHER NASSER IS PREPARED TO DROP OR MODIFY HIS PRESENTDETERMINATION TO UNITE ONLY WITH " LIBERATED " ARAB STATES AND TO SHUNMONARCHIES . SAID NEW JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER RIFAI : " WE HAVE OURPRIDE . WE ARE JUST AS HEALTHY AND STRONG AS ANY ARAB STATE . WE DON'TINTEND TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING, BUT WE DO INTEND TO PROCLAIM OUR GOODWILL AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO ARAB UNITY . " THEN HE ADDED HOPEFULLY, "THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE NEW ARAB UNION TO WELCOME JORDAN AND NOREASON TO BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY . WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM THANMANY REPUBLICS . WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ANYWAY BETWEEN A CONSTITUTIONALPRESIDENT AND A CONSTITUTIONAL KING ? /
