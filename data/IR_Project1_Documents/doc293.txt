WHEN BURGESS AND MACLEAN ELOPED TO RUSSIA IN 1951, PHILBY WASFORCED TO RESIGN FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE AMIDST A FLURRY OF RUMORS THATHE WAS " THE THIRD MAN " WHO HAD TIPPED THEM OFF THAT THE POLICE WEREON THEIR TRAIL . LATER, THIS CHARGE WAS INDIGNANTLY DENIED BY HAROLDMACMILLAN, THEN FOREIGN SECRETARY, WHO PERSONALLY VOUCHED FOR PHILBY'SGOOD CHARACTER . THE FOREIGN OFFICE EVEN ASKED THE OBSERVER TO HIREPHILBY AS A CORRESPONDENT BECAUSE " IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT SO ABLE A MANSHOULD BE FINDING DIFFICULTY IN EARNING A LIVING NOW THAT HE HADCLEARANCE FROM THE FOREIGN SECRETARY . " THE PUBLICATION TOOK THE HINTAND, ALONG WITH THE ECONOMIST, SENT PHILBY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHEREHIS FATHER, ST . JOHN PHILBY, THE FAMED ARAB SCHOLAR, HAD SPENT YEARSEXPLORING THE DESERT .

IN MOSCOW, GUY BURGESS WAS AMUSED BY THE REVELATIONS INPARLIAMENT . " MARK YOU, MY DEAR BOY, " HE TOLD A REPORTER, " THELONGER I STAY IN THE SOVIET UNION AND READ ABOUT THE SCANDALS INENGLAND, THE MORE GLAD I AM TO BE HERE, THE MORE I BELIEVE THAT ANYCIVILIZED PERSON LIKE PHILBY MIGHT EASILY WANT TO COME HERE . " BUTBURGESS DENIED THAT PHILBY OR ANYONE ELSE HAD WARNED HIM AND MACLEANTHAT THEY WERE UNDER SUSPICION . IN FACT, DECLARED BURGESS, MACLEANONLY LEARNED THAT HE WAS BEING TAILED WHEN A LONDON TAXI HE WAS RIDINGIN ONE DAY WAS RAMMED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT BY A CARFUL OF BRITISHSECRET SERVICE AGENTS . SUMMING UP " THIS LATEST SCHEMOZZLE " INVOLVINGTHE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, BURGESS REMARKED : " SOMEONE ONCE SAID, "THERE IS NOTHING SO SQUALID AS A PATRICIAN IN A PANIC.' THE HEAD OFBRITISH SECURITY IS USUALLY A PATRICIAN, AND PANIC SEEMS TO BEUNIVERSAL . " BACK HOME, THE TORIES MIGHT NOT BE PANICKED, BUT THEYWERE SHOWING A BAD CASE OF THE JITTERS .
