AUSTRIA TWO ON THE SEESAW EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II EVEN THROUGH TENYEARS OF SOVIET OCCUPATION THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RUN JOINTLYBY THE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE'S PARTY AND THE SOCIALIST PARTY, LIKE TWOPOLITE, EQUALLY WEIGHTED COUSINS ON AN INERT SEESAW . SO SCRUPULOUSLYBALANCED IS THE COALITION AND THE PROPORZ SYSTEM OF DIVIDING UP THEJOBS THAT, ACCORDING TO VIENNESE TABLE TALK, IF THERE IS ONE PEOPLE'SPARTY PUTZFRAU (CHARWOMAN) IN A GOVERNMENT BUILDING, THERE MUST BE ASOCIALIST PUTZFRAU TOO . AFTER LAST NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS, BALANCEBECAME STALEMATE ; THE TWO BIG PARTIES HAVE BEEN HAGGLING OVER ACABINET EVER SINCE . A GROUP OF VOCIFEROUS PEOPLE'S PARTY REFORMERSARGUED FOR LESS OF THE TRADITIONAL COOPERATION WITH THE SOCIALISTS, BUTTHE MEAGER VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY 81 SEATS TO 76 FOR THESOCIALISTS WAS HARDLY A MANDATE FOR SWEEPING CHANGE . STILL,CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR ALFONS GORBACH SHARED THE REFORMERS' FEELINGTHAT THE EXTRA STRENGTH ENTITLED HIS PARTY TO AT LEAST ONE MOREMINISTRY . THE ONE IN MIND : THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, WHERE SOCIALISTBRUNO KREISKY WAS THE PRIME TARGET OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY REFORMERS .THE CONSERVATIVES ARGUED THAT A SOCIALIST COULD NOT POSSIBLY PUT HISHEART INTO THE VITAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR AUSTRIAN ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP INTHE COMMON MARKET, WHICH, AFTER ALL, WAS A TRIUMPH OF CAPITALISM . FORMORE THAN FOUR MONTHS, THE SOCIALISTS AND PEOPLE'S PARTY NEGOTIATORSMET ALMOST DAILY IN THE ORNATE BALLHAUS PALACE TO ARGUE ABOUT THECABINET, AND ALL THE WHILE AUSTRIA HUMMED ALONG HAPPILY UNDER APROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THAT WAS PRECISELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD .LAST WEEK THE BICKERING ENDED AT LAST WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTY ON THESHORT END . THE ABLE, PERSONABLE KREISKY STAYED ON AS FOREIGN MINISTER,AND THIS VICTORY FOR THE SOCIALISTS WAS COUNTERED ONLY BY THE ADDITIONOF A FEW PEOPLE'S PARTY STATE SECRETARIES TO THE TRADE AND JUSTICEMINISTRIES . ANOTHER SOCIALIST, FORMER TRADE UNION BOSS FRANZ OLAH,TOOK OVER THE INTERIOR MINISTRY, WHERE HE IS IN CONTROL OF THECOUNTRY'S POLICE POWER . OLAH IS AN ABLE MAN, BUT FOR MANY AUSTRIANSHIS APPOINTMENT MEANS TROUBLE . ON HIS SECOND DAY IN OFFICE, HE TOLD APRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE FELT IT PERFECTLY PROPER FOR HIS COPS TOSTRIKE IF THEY WANTED TO .
