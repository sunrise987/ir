COMMUNISTS A FAN OF HENRY FORD'S FROM HISOWN CRIMEANESTATE WITH ITS NOW-FAMED BADMINTON COURT AND GLASS-ENCLOSED SWIMMINGPOOL, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV LAST WEEK TRAVELED TO MARSHAL TITO'S WONDERLANDIN YUGOSLAVIA . FROM A STATE DINNER AT BELGRADE'S WHITE PALACE,KHRUSHCHEV WENT ON AN ADRIATIC CRUISE ABOARD TITO'S YACHT GALEB(SEAGULL), SPENT THREE DAYS AT TITO'S ISLAND RETREAT OF BRIONI, THEN TOTITO'S 400-YEAR-OLD CASTLE IN THE DINARIC ALPS, NEXT TO TITO'S SUMMERRESIDENCE AT BRDA AND, FINALLY, TO TITO'S CROATIAN HUNTING LODGE ATBELJE . TO THE CHINESE, WHO HAVE LONG COMPLAINED THAT KHRUSHCHEV HASGONE OVER TO THE ENEMY CAMP BOTH IDEOLOGICALLY AND IN HIS PERSONALTASTES, ALL THIS MUST HAVE SEEMED INFURIATING PARTICULARLY SINCE HOSTTITO IS THEIR IDEOLOGICAL ARCHENEMY, THE " REVISIONIST " WHO FIRSTBROKE WITH STALIN AND ESTABLISHED A MORE OR LESS INDEPENDENT BRAND OFMARXISM . AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS QUARREL WITH PEKING, AND WITH A CERTAINUNREST AMONG THE SOVIET SATELLITES, KHRUSHCHEV WAS CLEARLY DRAWINGCLOSER TO TITO, EVEN HINTED THAT YUGOSLAVIA MIGHT BE ALLOWED TOPARTICIPATE IN COMECON, THE CREAKY EASTERN COMMON MARKET . TITO IN TURNSEEMED DETERMINED TO SUGGEST THAT, EVEN IF MOSCOW ACCEPTS HIMWHOLEHEARTEDLY AS A COMRADE, HE RETAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE ; IN DOING SOHE PRESUMABLY HAD AN EYE ON WASHINGTON, WHERE CONGRESS THIS WEEKCONSIDERS WHETHER TO RESTORE THE PREVIOUSLY CANCELEDMOST-FAVORED-NATIONRATING FOR YUGOSLAV EXPORTS TO THE U.S . CRACKED A YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL :/ WE DIDN'T SIGN A TREATY WITH KHRUSHCHEV AS YOU AMERICANS DID . WEDIDN'T EVEN PLAY BADMINTON WITH HIM . " MAMA'S CHILDREN . THE TWOLEADERS DID JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AS THEY RANGED THE COUNTRY FROMQUAKE-SHATTERED SKOPLJE TO WILD MONTENEGRO, WHERE AFTER A PICNIC THEMOUNTAINFOLK BROKE INTO THE KOLO, A FIERY, FOOTSTAMPING CIRCLE DANCE .KHRUSHCHEV AND HIS STOLID WIFE NINA, AND TITO AND HIS STATUESQUE SPOUSEJOVANKA, BROKE INTO THE RING, LOCKING ARMS AND SWIRLING AROUND WITH THEPRETTY GIRLS AND PEASANTS . THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE PART OF THE VISIT CAMEAT THE RAKOVICA AUTO PLANT OUTSIDE BELGRADE . IN A DISCUSSION WITH THEWORKERS, KHRUSHCHEV SEEMED FASCINATED BY THE YUGOSLAV FACTORY SYSTEM OFDECENTRALIZED, LOCALLY ADMINISTERED SOCIALISM THROUGH WORKERS' COUNCILSELECTED BY THE EMPLOYEES AND EMPOWERED TO FIRE OR REVERSE THE DECISIONSOF THE PLANT MANAGER . THE SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN DENOUNCED BY REDCHINESE IDEOLOGUES, AND BY RUSSIA SINCE YUGOSLAVIA WAS KICKED OUT OFTHE COMINTERN IN 1948 . EVEN KHRUSHCHEV ONCE SNEERED, " THE WORKERS'COUNCILS ARE ONLY GOOD WHEN THEY ARE PROPPED UP BY AMERICAN GRAIN ANDMEAT . " REVERSING HIMSELF, KHRUSHCHEV CALLED THE COUNCILS A /PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT " AND SAID RUSSIA WAS FACING THE QUESTION OF "WHETHER OR NOT CONDITIONS ARE RIPE FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OFMANAGEMENT . UNLESS THERE IS A FORCE OF PUBLIC OPINION OUR MANAGERSTEND TO BECOME AUTOCRATS . OF COURSE, YOUR SYSTEM MAY NOT BE TOTALLY INLINE WITH THE LENINIST PRINCIPLE OF UNIFIED LEADERSHIP . DON'T YOU EVERHAVE TROUBLE BETWEEN WORKERS AND DIRECTORS ? " ASSURED THATDISAGREEMENTS WERE ALWAYS WORKED OUT, KHRUSHCHEV SHOOK HIS HEADSKEPTICALLY AND SAID, " YOU'RE A LITTLE BOASTFUL BUT, OF COURSE, MAMAALWAYS SAYS HER CHILDREN ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL . YOU'VE GOT YOURSHORTCOMINGS BUT THEN SO DO WE . " PLASTER BUST . WARMING UP,KHRUSHCHEV DEMANDED : " WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM NOW ? ITIS TO BEAT CAPITALISM . THE ONE WHO CREATES THE MOST THROUGH MASSPRODUCTION WILL WIN . HENRY FORD HAS SHOWN US HOW TO DO IT . " HEADDED, " AFTER THE REVOLUTION, WE SENT A DELEGATION TO HENRY FORD ANDASKED HIM TO HELP US BUILD A FACTORY THAT WOULD PRODUCE 30,000 CARS AYEAR . FORD TOLD US THAT A FACTORY MAKING ONLY 30,000 WOULD NOT WORK .THE CAR WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE . HE SAID WE SHOULD COME BACK WHEN WEWERE READY TO PRODUCE 120,000 A YEAR . " TO ILLUSTRATE THE LESSONS OFPRODUCTIVITY, KHRUSHCHEV EVEN RAMBLED OFF INTO BIBLICAL HISTORY,INACCURATELY RECALLING THAT CHRIST HAD FED 40,000 PERSONS WITH A SINGLELOAF OF BREAD . WITH HIS USUAL HEAVY-FOOTED HUMOR HE ADDED, " BUT NOONE KNOWS IF ALL GOT ENOUGH TO EAT . IF THEY HAD, THEY WOULD NOT HAVELEFT PALESTINE . " AS FOR THE CHINESE : " THEY SAY THAT THEIR COUNTRYHAS TO RELY ON ITS OWN RESOURCES . IT IS TRUE AND IT IS NOT TRUE . IFYOU LOCK YOURSELF WITHIN YOUR OWN FRONTIERS, YOU LOSE YOUR ECONOMICPOTENTIAL . THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO RELY ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, ANDTHEN THEY WRITE TO US FOR CREDITS . " THE ENTRANCED WORKERS AT RAKOVICARESPONDED TO ALL THIS BY HANDING KHRUSHCHEV A PRESENT HE MUST HAVE LONGWANTED AND NEEDED : A PLASTER BUST OF LENIN . PRESUMABLY NONE OF HENRYFORD WAS AVAILABLE .
