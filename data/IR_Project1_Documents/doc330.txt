STALINSVILLE ON THE STYX PRIVATE VASILY TERKIN WAS THE ETERNAL SADSACHA, AND HIS FICTIONAL MILITARY EXPLOITS POKED SLY FUN AT SOVIETOFFICERDOM THROUGHOUT WORLD WAR II . RUSSIANS COMPLAINED MIGHTILY WHENHIS CREATOR, POET ALEKSANDR TRIFONOVICH TVARDOVSKY, FAILED TO BRING HIMHOME FROM THE WARS . LAST WEEK, TO THEIR DELIGHT, VASILY WAS BACK WITHA DIFFERENCE . THE SOLDIER'S RETURN WAS CHRONICLED IN A SUBTLE, STYLISHNEW POEM BY TVARDOVSKY THAT WAS SPREAD ACROSS TWO PAGES OF IZVESTIAUNDER A WARMLY APPROVING INTRODUCTION BY EDITOR ALEKSEI ADZHUBEI,KHRUSHCHEV'S SON-IN-LAW . IN STALIN'S DAY, FOR ALL HIS BUFFOONERY,TERKIN ULTIMATELY HAD TO SYMBOLIZE " THE IDEAL SOVIET SOLDIER " ; INHIS LATEST ADVENTURE, HE IS A COCKILY IRREVERENT FIGURE WHO GETS KILLEDIN BATTLE AND GOES TO A " NETHER WORLD " THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A SORT OFSTALINSVILLE ON THE STYX . HELL, TERKIN FINDS, IS LIKE THE MOSCOWSUBWAY, " ONLY LOWER . " IT IS RUN BY A PAMPERED ARMY OF BUREAUCRATS,WHO SPEND THEIR DAYS PLAYING DOMINOES AND YELLING AT THE INMATES TOKEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY . A MODEL OF COMMUNIST PLANNING, THE NETHER WORLDHAS MENUS BUT NO FOOD, STEAM BATHS WITHOUT STEAM, HOTELS WITHOUT BEDS .THERE IS EVEN A MAGAZINE EDITOR WHO " SWEATS ALL OVER " AS HE " PUTS INQUOTES AND TAKES THEM OUT AGAIN AND READS EACH PAGE FROM TOP TO BOTTOMAND FROM BOTTOM TO TOP . " SAYS ONE BIG BROTHERLY GHOST : " YOU DON'THAVE TO TALK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK AT ALL . " TERKIN FINALLY MANAGESTO ESCAPE AND WAKES UP IN A HOSPITAL ON EARTH, WHERE DOCTORSCONFIDENTLY PREDICT THAT HE WILL LIVE TO BE 100 . THE MORAL OF TERKIN'STRIP, TVARDOVSKY SUGGESTS, IS THAT ALL RUSSIANS SHARE THE BLAME FORSTALIN BECAUSE THEY RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO HIS EXCESSES INSTEAD OFRESISTING THEM . HOWEVER, THE POET ALSO URGES RUSSIANS TO STOP HARPINGON STALINISM, WHICH HAS BEEN KHRUSHCHEV'S LINE OF LATE . TERKIN'SRESURRECTION WAS A SIGN THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD DECIDED TO SOFTEN ACAMPAIGN AGAINST CONTROVERSIAL WRITING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCEDECEMBER . IN FACT, EDITOR ADZHUBEI NOTEDREASSURINGLY, NIKITA LIKED THE POEM AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHEN IT WAS READTO HIM BEFORE PUBLICATION .
