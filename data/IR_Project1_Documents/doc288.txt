SOUTH VIET NAM THE HEART OF QUANG DUC HEADS BOWED, PALMS PRESSEDTOGETHER IN PRAYER, THOUSANDS OF BUDDHISTS FILED QUIETLY THROUGHSAIGON'S XA LOI PAGODA LAST WEEK TO WITNESS WHAT MOST OF THEM BELIEVEDTO BE A MIRACLE . AMID THE FRAGRANCE OF INCENSE-BURNING REEDS,YELLOWROBED PRIESTS CHANTED FROM SUNRISE TO MIDNIGHT, LAYMEN GAZED INAWE, AND WEEPING WOMEN HELD CHILDREN UP TO SEE IT ALL . ON THE ALTAR,INSIDE A CRYSTAL URN, WHICH IN TURN WAS ENCASED IN A BOUQUETFLANKEDGLASS CHEST, LAY THE OBJECT OF THEIR REVERENCE A CHARRED PIECE OF FLESH. UNDER IT A HAND-LETTERED SIGN ANNOUNCED : " THE ETERNAL HEAT OF HIGHPRIEST QUANG DUC . " TWO WEEKS EARLIER, TO DRAMATIZE THE BUDDHISTMAJORITY'S FIGHT FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM UNDER SOUTH VIET NAM'SROMAN CATHOLIC PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM, A 73-YEAR-OLD BUDDHIST MONKNAMED THICH QUANG DUC HAD SPECTACULARLY SET HIMSELF AFIRE IN A SAIGONSTREET . LATER THE MARTYR'S SCORCHED REMAINS WERE ASSIGNED TO FINALCREMATION IN A RICE FIELD OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL . BUT, AS THE PRIESTSTOLD IT, WHEN THE OLD MAN'S ASHES WERE REMOVED FROM THE OVEN, HIS HEARTEMERGED MIRACULOUSLY UNDESTROYED OBVIOUSLY THE SUPERNATURAL WORK OFBUDDHA . IMMEDIATELY, HIS FELLOW MONKS PROCLAIMED QUANG DUC A SAINT .SKEPTICS SUGGESTED THE QUANG DUC'S HEART HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BODYBEFORE CREMATION, OR HAD BEEN INJECTED WITH A FIRE-RESISTING FLUID .CERTAINLY THE PHENOMENON WAS FAR FROM ORIGINAL ; DOWN THROUGH THEAGES, IN LEGEND AND FACT, THE HEARTS OF HEROIC FIGURES HAVE MORE THANONCE WITHSTOOD THE FLAMES. BUT THE " MIRACLE " SERVES THE BUDDHISTS INTHEIR TWO-MONTH-OLD WAR WITH DIEM . THANKS PARTLY TO PRESSURE FROM THEU.S., WHICH FEARS THAT MASSIVE BUDDHIST DISAFFECTION COULD WRECK SOUTHVIET NAM'S LONG, VITAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, THE DIEMGOVERNMENT SIGNED A COMPROMISE AGREEING TO LET THE BUDDHISTS FLY THEIROWN FLAG AND PROMISING TO EASE ANTI-BUDDHIST DISCRIMINATION E REGIMEFAILS TO SHOW GOOD FAITH, THE BUDDHISTS VOW, THEY WILL START NEWDEMONSTRATIONS AND THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE SYMBOL OF QUANG DUC'SDURABLE HEART TO HELP KEEP THE FAITHFUL INSPIRED .WHEN GAUTAMA BUDDHA'S BODY WASCREMATED, TRADITION HAS IT, SOME PARTS OF IT FAILED TO BURN . JOAN OFARC'S HEART IS SAID TO HAVE SURVIVED HER BURNING AT THE STAKE AND BEENTHROWN INTO THE SEINE . WHEN PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY DROWNED OFF ITALY IN1822, THREE LITERARY FRIENDS LORD BYRON, EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY AND LEIGHHUNT CREMATED THE CORPSE ON A PYRE OF DRIFTWOOD . THE JOB ALMOST DONE,TRELAWNY SUDDENLY THRUST IN HIS ARM AND SNATCHED OUT THE HEART, WHICH,ALTHOUGH FIERY HOT, WAS STRANGELY UNCONSUMED . IN OSCAR WILDE'S FAIRYTALE, THE HAPPY PRINCE, THE STATUE'S BROKEN HEART FAILS TO MELT IN THEFURNACE .
