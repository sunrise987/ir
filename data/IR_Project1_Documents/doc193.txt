FRANCE LIBERTE, EGALITE MAIS VERITE ? " EVERY FRENCHMAN, " BYANCIENT AXIOM, " IS WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS COUNTRY ; BUT NONE ISWILLING TO PAY FOR IT . " SO PASSIONATELY DO THE FRENCH PURSUE THEIRDEMOCRATIC IDEAL OF REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION THAT CHEATING LEFISC, AS THEY CALL THE INCOME TAX BUREAU, HAS BECOME THE MOST PERVASIVEAND ENGROSSING NATIONAL PASSTIME AFTER LOVE-MAKING AND A FAR LESS RISKYONE . AS A RESULT OF THE CENTURIES-OLD DUEL BETWEEN CHRONICALLYSTRAPPED GOVERNMENTS AND PERENNIALLY POOR-MOUTHED CITIZENS, FRANCE INTHEORY IMPOSES HIGHER INCOME TAXES THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER WESTERNCOUNTRY, AND IN PRACTICE COLLECTS LESS : A MERE 14 PER CENT OFGOVERNMENT REVENUE V . 60 PER CENT IN THE U.S . " EVERYBODY IS ACONSPIRATOR, " LAMENTED PREMIER (AND ONETIME BANKER) GEORGES POMPIDOUAS HIS GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A FACT-FINDING PROGRAM CALLED OPERATIONVERITE (OPERATION TRUTH), WHOSE MAIN AIM IS TO GET FRENCHMEN TO DO WHATCOMES UNNATURALLY TO REPORT THEIR EARNINGS . WHY, CRIED THE PREMIER, "IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EVEN WHAT A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE EARNS! " IN 1961, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES, AT LEAST 36 MILLION OFFRANCE'S 46 MILLION PEOPLE PAID NOT A SINGLE SOU OF INCOME TAX ; BYTHE MOST CONSERVATIVE RECKONING, 50 PER CENT OF THOSE WHO SHOULD PAYTAXES GOT OFF SCOT-FREE . EVEN MORE REMARKABLE, IN THE MIDST OFUNPARALLELED UPPER-CRUST OPULENCE, WAS THAT IN ALL FRANCE ONLY 1,014CITIZENS BARELY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ONE OF PARIS' #$ #$ #$ RESTAURANTSADMITTED TO EARNING MORE THAN $12,800 A YEAR . FISCAL CAMOUFLAGE . THEINJUSTICE OF THE SYSTEM IS THAT HAPLESS WAGE EARNERS, WHOSE INCOMES ARERECORDED ON COMPANY PAYROLLS AND ARE THUS EASILY AVAILABLE TO LE FISC,SHELL OUT TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE INCOME TAXES COLLECTED IN FRANCE .WHILE THE RICH GET RICHER, THANKS TO AN ECONOMIC BOOM AND THE NATIVEGENIUS FOR FISCAL CAMOUFLAGE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE MOST SHOULDER MASSIVECONSUMER TAXES, SUCH AS THE 74 PER CENT LEVY THAT MAKES FRENCH GASOLINE(90 #$ A GALLON) EUROPE'S MOST EXPENSIVE . TAX REFORM HAS SELDOM SEEMEDMORE IMPERATIVE, FOR THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS URGENTLY TO BE ASSURED OFEVER-RISING REVENUES FOR SUCH HUGE UNDERTAKINGS AS ITS FORCE DE FRAPPE,INCLUDING AN EXTRAVAGANT THREE-YEAR BUILDUP FOR FRANCE'S FIRST HBOMBTESTS IN THE PACIFIC, ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK . AT THE SAME TIME, THEECONOMY IS THREATENED BY A BURST OF INFLATION THAT HAS BOOSTED INCOMESAND PRICES 11 PER CENT IN THE PAST YEAR AND THREATENS TO GET OUT OFHAND IN THE WAKE OF THE RECENT, SUCCESSFUL MINERS' STRIKE FOR HIGHERPAY . POODLES & PICASSOS . TO PUT TEETH IN ITS TAX-EXTRACTION CAMPAIGN,THE GOVERNMENT HAS UNLEASHED A HORDE OF EXPERT SNOOPERS WHO DESCENDUNEXPECTEDLY ON COMPANIES AND CAN SPOT A PADDED PAYROLL AS UNERRINGLYAS A MICHELIN INSPECTOR EXPOSING A WARMED-OVER SAUCE BEARNAISE . BUTEXPERIENCE PROVES THAT IT WILL TAKE FAR MORE RUTHLESS MEASURES TO MAKEINDIVIDUAL FRENCHMEN DIVULGE THEIR TRUE EARNINGS . IN 1947, WHEN ROBERTSCHUMAN WAS FINANCE MINISTER, THE GOVERNMENT DID ITS BEST BYINTRODUCING THE THEORY OF " EXTERNAL SIGNS OF WEALTH, " A WONDROUSLYCOMPLEX LATIN FORMULA WHEREBY TAX INSPECTORS GAUGED A MAN'S RICHESSE BYCOUNTING AND GRADING HIS SERVANTS, CARS, YACHTS, DOGS (PUREBRED ORMONGREL ? ) AND DECLARABLE MISTRESSES . AS A RESULT, WEALTHYPARISIANS LET THE PAINT PEEL FROM THEIR HOUSES, PUT THEIR PICASSOS INTHE ATTIC, AND CLAIMED THAT THEIR PEDIGREED POODLES WERE USEDEXCLUSIVELY AS WATCHDOGS, WHICH ARE TAXEXEMPT . (LE FISC FINALLYABANDONED ITS HIT-AND-MISTRESS METHODS THIS YEAR.) WHEN THE INSPECTORSSTARTED DEMANDING TAXPAYERS' FINANCIAL RECORDS, ARTFUL FRENCHMEN FROMPLUMBERS TO LANDLORDS RETALIATED BY INSISTING ON CASH FOR THEIRSERVICES ; THE MOST FASHIONABLE DOCTOR IN PARIS TODAY WOULD SOONERVOTE FOR SOCIALIZED MEDICINE THAN ACCEPT A PATIENT'S CHECK . THEGOVERNMENT'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT HONESTY, AS FRENCH TAXPAYERS SEEIT, IS NOT MERELY IRRELEVANT BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY DISASTROUS AS WELL .A HIGH-MINDED YOUNG PARISIAN ARTIST ONCE FILED A SCRUPULOUSLY ACCURATETAX RETURN AND WAS HORRFIED TO FIND THAT THE SKEPTICAL LOCAL INSPECTOR,APPLYING THE STANDARD CORRECTION FACTOR, CREDITED HIM WITH THREE TIMESTHE INCOME HE REPORTED . THIS WEEK THE GOVERNMENT PRESENTED ANAMBITIOUS PROGRAM OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM TO THE NATIONALASSEMBLY, AND THE PERENNIAL QUESTION OF HOW TO PAY FOR IT ONCE AGAINCAME TO THE FORE . OF COURSE, DE GAULLE COULD ALWAYS IMITATE THEANGLO-SAXONS AND SEND TAX EVADERS TO JAIL . BUT THEN HOW WOULD HE RAISETHE REVENUE TO BUILD ALL THOSE NEW PRISONS ?
