FOR A WHILE HE SAT DRINKING WITH THEMAT HIS HOME IN SAIGON . " MY SONS, I FEEL VERY HAPPY TONIGHT, " HE SAID. " I AM GOING TO DIE VERY SOON . " SUDDENLY HE KEELED OVER, WAS RUSHEDTO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE DIED NEXT MORNING . IN HIS GLASS WAS FOUND ALETHAL DOSE OF CYANIDE . NOVELIST TAM, 58, WAS A REVOLUTIONARY LEADERIN INDO-CHINA'S WAR AGAINST THE FRENCH . BUT AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN1954, HE GREW INCREASINGLY DISENCHANTED WITH THE AUTHORITARIAN RULE OFSOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM . FORTNIGHT AGO, DIEM'SGOVERNMENT CHARGED TAM AND 34 OTHERS WITH TREASON BY CONSPIRING TOOVERTHROW THE PRESIDENT IN AN ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPT IN NOVEMBER 1960 .IT WAS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TRIAL THAT TAM COMMITTEDSUICIDE, AND HE EXPLAINED WHY IN A NOTE HE LEFT BEHIND . " THE ARRESTAND TRIAL OF ALL NATIONALIST OPPONENTS OF THE REGIME IS A CRIME THATWILL FORCE THE NATION INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS, " HE WROTE . "I OPPOSE THIS CRIME, AND I KILL MYSELF AS A WARNING TO THOSE PEOPLE WHOARE TRAMPLING ON OUR FREEDOMS . " DRAGGING FEET . DIEM'S GOVERNMENTMOVED QUICKLY TO HEAD OFF DEMONSTRATIONS OVER TAM'S DEATH, POSTHUMOUSLYACQUITTED HIM OF ALL CONSPIRACY CHARGES AT THE SAIGON TREASON TRIAL .AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROSECUTORS TRIED TO IMPLICATE THE U.S . AS BEINGBEHIND THE 1960 COUP ; THE CHARGE WAS VIGOROUSLY DENIED BY THE U.S .AT THE END OF THE TRIAL, GOVERNMENT JUDGES SENTENCED 20 DEFENDANTS TOPRISON TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS ; NINE OTHERS WHO HADFLED THE COUNTRY AFTER THE ATTEMPTED COUP WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH INABSENTIA . TAM'S SUICIDE AND THE SAIGON TRIAL SERVED ONCE AGAIN TOSTOKE SOUTH VIET NAM'S SMOLDERING RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CRISIS . LASTMONTH BUDDHIST MONK THICH QUANG DUC BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH ON A SAIGONSTREET CORNER IN PROTEST AGAINST RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE COUNTRY'S12 MILLION BUDDHISTS BY DIEM'S PREDOMINANTLY ROMAN CATHOLIC REGIME .AFTER A SERIES OF NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT, UNDER U.S. PRODDING, YIELDED TO BUDDHIST DEMANDS AND GRANTED THEM EQUALRELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL STANDING WITH THE NATION'S 1,500,000 CATHOLICS. BUT INFLUENCED BY HIS BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU, WHO BELIEVES THAT THEBUDDHISTS ARE RED DUPES, THE MILITANTLY CATHOLIC DIEM HAS DRAGGED HISFEET IN IMPLEMENTING THESE CONCESSIONS . MANY VIETNAMESE BUDDHISTS,SAYS NHU, " HAVE BECOME FANATIC, LOST THEIR COMMON SENSE, AND ARE READYTO FOLLOW ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO EXPLOIT THEM UNDER THE BANNER OFRELIGION . " THIS WAS THE KIND OF DOGGED ANTI-BUDDHIST ATTITUDE THATHAS DANGEROUSLY UNDERCUT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT . ALREADY ONE GENERAL HASRESIGNED HIS FIELD COMMAND IN PROTEST OVER GOVERNMENT BUNGLING OF THEBUDDHIST ISSUE . SIMPLE REASON . DIEM'SINTRANSIGENCE HAS DISMAYED U.S . OFFICIALS, WHO FEAR THAT MOUNTINGBUDDHIST DISCONTENT CAN ONLY HINDER THE WAR EFFORT AGAINST THE VIETCONG, JUST WHEN IT IS BEGINNING TO GO WELL . OVER THE PAST YEAR,GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THEIR 14,000 U.S . MILITARY " ADVISERS " HAVEVASTLY INCREASED THEIR MOBILITY AND STRIKING POWER AGAINST THE REDGUERRILLAS . MORE THAN 7,000 " STRATEGIC HAMLETS " HAVE BEEN BUILT, NOWPROTECT 8,000,000 VIETNAMESE FROM VIET CONG RAIDS . DESPITE ALLMISGIVINGS, THE U.S . STILL STANDS BEHIND DIEM FOR A SIMPLE REASON THATHE HIMSELF SPELLED OUT IN A BLUNT WARNING LAST WEEK : " FOR A MOMENT,IMAGINE THAT ANOTHER GOVERNMENT REPLACES THIS ONE : IT COULD NOT HELPRESULTING IN CIVIL WAR AND DREADFUL DICTATORSHIP . " WASHINGTON HASCONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES TO DIEM, BUT FEARS THAT THE CONFUSION OF A COUPCOULD ONLY BENEFIT THE VIET CONG AND MIGHT END UP WITH A REGIME NOBETTER THAN THE PRESENT ONE . THUS U.S . AMBASSADOR FREDERICK NOLTING,WHO IS SOON TO BE REPLACED BY HENRY CABOT LODGE, RETURNED TO SAIGONFROM WASHINGTON CONSULTATIONS LAST WEEK WITH A PERSONAL MESSAGE OFCONFIDENCE FOR DIEM FROM JOHN KENNEDY . BUT NOLTING ALSO LIGHTLY RAPPEDDIEM ON THE KNUCKLES FOR LETTING THE BUDDHIST CRISIS CONTINUE . " THEU.S . STANDS FOR AND SUPPORTS FREEDOM OF RELIGION FOR ALL PEOPLE, " HESAID . " IT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY IF THE GAINS AGAINST THE VIET CONG WEREWIPED OUT BY DISSENSIONS AMONG VIETNAMESE CITIZENS, WHO DESIRE ABOVEALL FREEDOM OF CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR COUNTRY .WATCHING ONE BUDDHISTDEMONSTRATION IN SAIGON LAST WEEK, NINE U.S . REPORTERS WERE JOSTLED BYGOVERNMENT POLICE AND HAD THEIR CAMERAS SMASHED . THE COPS SAID THEREPORTERS HAD STARTED THE ROW . THE VOCIFEROUSLY ANTIDIEM U.S . PRESSCORPS IN SAIGON PROTESTED TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY .
