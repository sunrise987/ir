DURING THEIR LAST WEEK IN MOSCOW, WHILE WESTERN NEGOTIATIORSWERE FETED AND FLATTERED, A KIND OF GREAT WALL SURROUNDED THE UNWELCOMEVISITORS FROM PEKING . FROM THEIR ISOLATED COMPOUND ON MOSCOW'S LENINHILLS, THE RED CHINESE DELEGATES VENTURED OUT ONLY IN CURTAINED BLACKCHAIKA LIMOUSINES FOR THE SHORT DRIVE TO PEKING'S EMBASSY ; ONALTERNATE DAYS THEY MET WITH A SOVIET DELEGATION, OBVIOUSLY TO NOEFFECT . KHRUSHCHEV POINTEDLY STAYED AWAY FROM THE MEETINGS, ALTHOUGHHE WAS OTHERWISE ACTIVE IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND SOCIAL WHIRL . THE MOSCOWFILM FESTIVAL PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR LOTS OF PARTIES, AT WHICH WESTERNENVOYS AND SOVIET FUNCTIONARIES MIXED AMIABLY WITH SUCH MOVIE STARS ASSHELLY WINTERS, SUSAN STRASBERG, YVES MONTAND AND SIMONE SIGNORET . ATWEEK'S END KHRUSHCHEV FINALLY TURNED TO HIS OTHER GUESTS AND, IN ARELATIVELY GRACIOUS GESTURE, TOSSED THE RED CHINESE A FAREWELL DINNER .ALTHOUGH DESCRIBED AS " FRIENDLY, " THE MEAL COULD HAVE PRODUCED LITTLEBEYOND DYSPEPSIA, FOR KHRUSHCHEV HAD SPOILED THE TABLE TALK IN ADVANCE,DELIVERING AN ORATORICAL BLAST AT PEKING THAT IN EFFECT DECLAREDPOLITICAL WAR ON THE CHINESE . THE CHALLENGE . AT A MASSIVE RALLY OFPARTY BUREAUCRATS AND PROPAGANDISTS IN THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF THECONGRESSES, KHRUSHCHEV SPOKE WITH SUCH APOPLECTIC VEHEMENCE THAT AT ONEPOINT HE GROPED FOR WORDS AND RHETORICALLY BEGGED THE AUDIENCE : "HELP ME OUT . " BUT HE DIDN'T NEED MUCH HELP . ANGRILY DEFENDING HISDESTALINIZATION DRIVE AGAINST PEKING'S ATTACKS, HE DEMANDED : " WHATDO THEY WANT ? TO FRIGHTEN OUR PEOPLE, TO BRING BACK THE DAYS WHEN AMAN WENT TO HIS JOB AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD SEE HIS WIFE ANDCHILDREN AGAIN ? " DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A DRAMATIC WHISPER,KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT LETTERS TO HIM FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EXPRESSEDGRATITUDE FOR ENDING THE STALINIST TERROR . THEN HE ADDED :. " IFSTALIN HAD DIED TEN YEARS EARLIER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER . "THE SOVIET BOSS WAS EQUALLY CONTEMPTUOUS ON THE SUBJECT OF PEKING'SWARMONGERING FOREIGN POLICY . " THEY SAY ONE SHOULD START A REVOLUTION,A WAR, " HE SHOUTED, " AND ON THE CORPSES AND THE RUINS, A MOREPROSPEROUS SOCIETY WILL BE CREATED . AND WHO WOULD REMAIN IN THISPROSPEROUS SOCIETY ? WOULDN'T THE LIVING ENVY THE DEAD ? " DIRECTLYACCUSING THE CHINESE OF TRYING TO UNSEAT HIM, KHRUSHCHEV DARED PEKINGTO TAKE ITS CASE TO THE SOVIET PEOPLE : " I DECLARE TO THOSE WHO WOULDLIKE TO OVERTHROW US I CHALLENGE YOU, COMRADES LET'S PICK OUT ANY PLANTOR COLLECTIVE FARM . YOU PRESENT YOUR PROGRAM AND WE WILL PRESENT OURS. YOU WON'T NEED ARMOR OR A PILLOW FOR PROTECTION . OUR PEOPLE AREPOLITE . THEY'LL LISTEN AND SAY : " GET OUT OF HERE . /BOURGEOIS COMRADES .

IN EUROPE THE QUARREL IS NOISIEST AMONG THE ITALIANCOMRADES . NOWHERE DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY SEEM MORE BOURGEOIS ; FORJUST THAT REASON, NOWHERE IN EUROPE HAS PEKING FOUND MORE SUPPORTERSFOR ITS CREDO OF ALL-OUT REVOLUTION . IN PADUA A GROUP OF COMMUNISTPARTY MEMBERS, EXPELLED FOR FAVORING PEKING, PUBLISHED A PAMPHLETDENOUNCING RED BUREAUCRATS WHO LIVED THE SWEET LIFE, COMPLETE WITH "WIVES AND MISTRESSES IN JEWELS AND FURS . " SOME 30,000 ITALIAN REDS,MANY OF THEM SONS OF PROMINENT COMMUNISTS, HAVE FORMED ABOUT 20CHAPTERS OF THE CHINESE-ITALIAN FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY .

THE SOVIETS ARE COMPLAINING THAT AT THE RECENTASIAN-AFRICAN SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE IN TANGANYIKA, A RED CHINESEOFFICIAL TOLD THE MOSCOW DELEGATION : " THE WHITES HAVE NOTHING TO DOHERE . " SUCH A BLATANT RACIST LINE, ARGUES MOSCOW, IS PURSUED IN THEUNDERDEVELOPED AREAS AT RUSSIA'S EXPENSE ; IT " IMPLANTS THE SNEAKYIDEA THAT THE PEOPLES OF SOME REGIONS ARE MORE REVOLUTIONARY THANOTHERS . " INDIA'S COMMUNIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY DIVIDED, BUT LASTWEEK FORMALLY LINED UP WITH KHRUSHCHEV, JUST AS AN INDIAN GOVERNMENTPURCHASING COMMISSION ARRIVED IN MOSCOW SHOPPING FOR ARMS TO BE USED INDEFENSE AGAINST THE RED CHINESE . IN JAPAN, MOST OF WHOSE COMMUNISTSFAVOR RED CHINA FOR ETHNIC REASONS, THE STRUGGLE HAS BECOME PRETTYPETTY, RESULTING IN AN AIRMAIL CIRCULATION WAR . SOON AFTER PRAVDABEGAN TO ARRIVE IN TOKYO BY AIR, PEKING'S PEOPLE'S DAILY DROPPED ITSSEAMAIL DELIVERY, WHICH USED TO TAKE A MONTH, AND ALSO TOOK TO THE AIRAT NO INCREASE IN POSTAL RATES TO SUBSCRIBERS .

THIS MONTH PEKING HAPPILYPROCLAIMED THAT ITS EXPERTS HAVE HELPED THE CUBANS TO RAISE 25,000PEKING DUCKS . THESE SINO-SOVIET DUELS AROUND THE WORLD, AS MUCH AS THEFRUITLESS TALKS IN MOSCOW, HAVE SHATTERED ANY PROSPECT OF EARLYRECONCILIATION . NOW THAT THE MOSCOW MEETING HAS COLLAPSED, BOTH SIDESIN EFFECT CONCEDE THAT WHAT BEGAN AS A CHARADE OF UNITY HAS BECOME ACOMMUNIST NIGHTMARE .
