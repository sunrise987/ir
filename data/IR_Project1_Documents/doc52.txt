HE WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED . " ANUNDERSTANDING MAN, THE STATIONMASTER WIRED AHEAD TO NAGOYA . SUREENOUGH, IN ONE OF THE EMPTY CARS, THERE WERE THE BLACK LACE PANTIESTHAT THE WOMAN HAD BEEN WEARING UNTIL SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THERIB-CRUNCHING FREE-FOR-ALL INVOLVED IN GETTING ON AND OFF A TRAIN INJAPAN . THE LADY'S PLIGHT, PRESUMABLY THE RESULT OF FAILING ELASTIC ORFLAILING HANDS, IS A FAMILIAR ONE TO HARRIED J.N.R . OFFICIALS .
