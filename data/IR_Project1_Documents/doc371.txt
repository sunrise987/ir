INDIA UNDER THE BANYAN TREE MEETING UNDER A GAUDY CIRCUS TENT INTHE FABLED PINK CITY OF JAIPUR, THE LEADERS OF INDIA'S RULING CONGRESSPARTY TALKED THEMSELVES HOARSE LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST INTENSIVE EFFORTTO REFURBISH THEIR POLITICAL IMAGE SINCE INDEPENDENCE CAME IN 1947.PROPPED ON SAUSAGE-SHAPED BOLSTERS UNDER A HUGE PORTRAIT OF GANDHI, THEDHOTI-CLAD POLITICIANS PLEDGED "SELF-SACRIFICE" AND "DEMOCRATICSOCIALISM"--AND AT MEALTIMES ROARED OFF IN FIN-TAILED LIMOUSINES.ENDORSING "NONALIGNMENT," PARTY LEADERS WARNED RITUALISTICALLY AGAINST"ENTANGLEMENT WITH MILITARY BLOCS"- - EVEN AS U. S., BRITISH ANDINDIAN WARPLANES FLEW OVER NEW DELHI IN JOINT AIR EXERCISES.  AFTERA SIX-HOUR DEBATE ON THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM, THE DELEGATESADJOURNED THE TWO-DAY CONFERENCE AND WENT HOME TO GIVE THE SUBJECT MORETHOUGHT.BOOST FOR INDIRA.  ANOTHER SUBJECT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT, ONE THAT HASALMOST BECOME A NATIONAL OBSESSION, IS THE SUCCESSOR TO JAWAHARLALNEHRU, 74.  INDIA TODAY IS STILL SMARTING FROM THE SAVAGE BEATING ITTOOK AT THE HANDS OF RED CHINA LAST FALL, THE ECONOMY IS FALTERINGUNDER BUREAUCRATIC CONTROLS, AND THE FACTION-RIVEN GOVERNMENT ISFLAWED WITH CORRUPTION.  RESTIVE POLITICIANS SAY BLUNTLY THAT ALLTHEIR PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THE STOOPED, CAREWORN PRIMEMINISTER AND THE ELDERLY, OUT-OF-TOUCH CONGRESS PARTY LEADERSHIP.A CELEBRATED CRITICISM OF NEHRU IS THAT HE RESEMBLES INDIA'SBANYAN TREE, WHICH PROVERBIALLY KILLS EVERY OTHER ORGANISM THATGROWS IN ITS SHADE.  IN THE WAKE OF THREE PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTIONDEFEATS LAST SPRING, NEHRU ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD ASK A DOZEN TOPCABINET AND STATE MINISTERS TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDERTO LET THEM GO TO WORK REVITALIZING THE PARTY ORGANIZATION ANDREBUILDING ITS STRENGTH AMONG THE VOTERS.  BUT THE KAMARAJ PLANWAS REALLY USED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS A RUSE TO FLUSH OUT ALL THETOP CONTENDERS FOR HIS OWN JOB.  THERE IS EVEN WIDESPREADSUSPICION THAT NEHRU FORCED THE RESIGNATIONS OF HIS ABLEST MINISTERSIN ORDER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER, IMPERIOUS INDIRA GANDHI,45, WIDOW OF A BACKBENCH CONGRESS POLITICIAN (NO KIN TO THE MAHATMA),WHO HAS LONG BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLOSEST CONFIDANTE (HECALLS HER INDU, OR MOON), OFFICIAL HOSTESS AND POLITICALTROUBLESHOOTER.RULER OF THE WORLD.  BUT DISCOUNTING INDIRA AS A REAL POLITICALCONTENDER, THE CHOICE OF MOST PARTY MEMBERS AT PRESENT IS FORMER HOMEMINISTER LAL BAHADUR SHASTRI, 59, AN HONEST IF COLORLESS POLITICIAN WHO,LIKE HIS LEADER, COMES FROM UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA'S MOST POPULOUSSTATE AND THE TRADITIONAL BREEDING GROUND OF CONGRESS PARTY LEADERS.IF SHASTRI IS DISQUALIFIED--HE HAD A HEART ATTACK IN 1959--ALEADING CONTENDER FOR THE PRIMEMINISTERSHIP WOULD PROBABLY BES. K. PATIL, 63, A RIGHT-WINGER WHO RUNS BOMBAY WITH BRISK EFFICIENCYAND UNTIL THE CABINET PURGE COPED ABLY WITH THE THANKLESS JOB OFFOOD MINISTER, THOUGH GRAIN SHORTAGES PROMPTED THE CRACK THATHE "GAVE INDIA FOOD--FOR THOUGHT."MORARJI DESAI, 67, A STERN ASCETIC WHO WAS NEHRU'S FINANCEMINISTER AND WAS ONCE A FAVORITE TO SUCCEED HIM, HAS LOST MUCH OF HISPOPULARITY IN THE PAST YEAR, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF HIS DRACONIANMEASURES TO RAISE TAXES FOR THE DEFENSE EFFORT, BUT COULD STILL BETHE POWERFUL RIGHT WING'S CHOICE.AS FOR NEHRU, HE IS DETERMINED TO HOLD ON TO HIS POST INDEFINITELY,BUT EVEN INDIA'S MOST POPULAR MAN OCCASIONALLY FACES THELIMITATIONS OF FAME IN A COUNTRY THAT IS STILL ONLY 24 PER CENTLITERATE.  IN A SURVEY OF VILLAGERS LIVING LESS THAN 20 MILES FROMBUSTLING HYDERABAD, UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS REPORTED THAT PEASANTSVARIOUSLY IDENTIFIED NEHRU AS "HEAD OF A GERMAN STATE," "RULEROF THE WORLD," AND "SOME BRAHMAN."  NAMED FOR KAMARAJ NADAR,FORMER CHIEF MINISTER OF MADRAS, WHO FIRST EMPLOYED IT TOADVANTAGE IN HIS OWN STATE ADMINISTRATION.
