HE WAS EQUALLYSKILLFUL AT PRODUCING HARD-TO-GET GOODIES, OR BLACK-MARKETING THEIRCLOTHES OR WESTERN CURRENCY FOR A HANDSOME PROFIT . HE ALWAYS WENT OUTOF HIS WAY TO HELP THE LONELY ONES, SHOWED THEM THE SIGHTS, EVEN TOOKTHEM TO RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY INVARIABLY MET RUSSIANS WHO SEEMED NOTAT ALL AFRAID TO TALK FREELY WITH WESTERNERS . OLDER EMBASSY HANDS WERESKEPTICAL ABOUT SIG, KNOWING THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A SOVIET SPY . AFTERALL, LOCAL HELP IN MOSCOW MUST BE HIRED FROM U.P.D.K., THE GOVERNMENTPERSONNEL AGENCY FOR FOREIGN EMPLOYERS OF THE EMBASSY FIRED SIG, THEYREASONED, HE WOULD PROBABLY ONLY BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SPY WHO MIGHTBE A BOUNDER TO BOOT .

HOWEVER, ADMITTED THEREPORT, VASSALL'S YOUNG COLLEAGUES IN THE MOSCOW EMBASSY RIDICULED HIS/ EFFEMINATE " WAYS AND CALLED HIM " VERA . " THE PASSIONATE POLE SOONGUESSED HIS SECRET, AND LIFE BEGAN ANEW FOR VERA VASSALL . EAGER TOSHARE HIS NEW CONQUEST, SIG INTRODUCED VASSALL TO OTHER GAY TYPES . " ISHALL NEVER FORGET, " VASSALL WROTE TO AN OLDER MAN IN LONDON, " THEMANY UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENINGS THAT GO ON HERE, WHICH MUSTCOME TO FEW PEOPLE . " HE DID NOT APPARENTLY REGARD IT AS TOO UNUSUALWHEN ONE OF HIS NEW RUSSIAN FRIENDS PHOTOGRAPHED HIM IN THE ACT ONEEVENING . IT WAS NOT UNTIL VASSALL WAS CAUGHT REDHANDED WITH A SOVIETOFFICER THAT RUSSIAN SECRET POLICE INTERVENED AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THEGRAVITY OF HIS OFFENSE .
