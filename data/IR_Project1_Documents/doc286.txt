JAPAN FROM THE COW-WALK TO THE BRAWL EVER SINCE ITS FOUNDING 73YEARS AGO, THE JAPANESE DIET HAS HAD A HARD TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEENROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER AND THOSE OF THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY . JUSTAS THE TYPHOONS COME TO JAPAN IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS INAPRIL, THE PARLIAMENTARY BRAWLING SEASON ARRIVES IN JUNE, FILLING THEDIET WITH THE SOUND OF CRASHING FISTS AND STRANGLED CURSES . THIS YEARTHE SEASON ARRIVED ON SCHEDULE . MORE THAN SECRETARIES . BEFORE WORLDWAR II, BRAWLING WAS A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG HOT-BLOODED DELEGATES WHO,IN THE SAMURAI TRADITION, WERE REALLY HANKERING FOR MEDIEVAL DAYS WHENPOLITICAL DIFFERENCES WERE SETTLED WITH THE SWORD . THROUGHOUT THE DIETBUILDING, THE MAJOR CONSERVATIVE PARTIES STATIONED FLYING SQUADS OFYOUNG TOUGHS, KNOWN IRONICALLY AS INGAIDAN (LOBBYISTS), ALWAYS READYFOR HECKLING OR FIGHTING . DURING THE POSTWAR YEARS, THE U.S . TRIED TOENFORCE GOOD BEHAVIOR, BUT THE QUIET SPELL ENDED WITH THE LIFTING OFTHE OCCUPATION . THOUGH THE INGAIDAN WERE GONE, DIET MEMBERS HIREDHEAVY-FISTED BRAWLERS AS " SECRETARIES . " A BIG RIOT IN JUNE 1954INJURED SOME 50 PERSONS, FORCED LIBERAL PREMIER SHIGERU YOSHIDA TOCANCEL A LONG-PLANNED TRIP TO THE U.S . AND APOLOGIZE TO THE EMPEROR .SURVIVORS OF THAT FIGHT RECALL THE ARRIVAL OF AN OPPOSITION LEADER,BUKICHI ( " BIG BADGER " ) MIKI, WHO VEHEMENTLY OBJECTED TO WESTERNDRESS AND ALWAYS WORE A KIMONO . HE SHOWED UP FOR THE FIGHT DRESSED INARMY FATIGUES AND COMBAT BOOTS, EXPLAINED TO COLLEAGUES THAT " YOUCAN'T KICK WITH A KIMONO ON, YOU KNOW . " SINCE THEN, JAPAN'S EMERGENTSOCIALISTS HAVE INTRODUCED A WHOLE NEW ARRAY OF TECHNIQUES, MANY MOREOR LESS NONVIOLENT . THE MOST POPULAR IS USHI ARUKI, OR COW-WALKING .REALIZING THAT THEY CANNOT BLOCK THE OVERWHELMING CONSERVATIVEMAJORITY, THE SOCIALISTS DO THEIR BEST TO SLOW BUSINESS TO A STANDSTILL. IN BALLOTING SESSIONS, EACH SOCIALIST MEMBER GETS UP SLOWLY AS HISNAME IS CALLED, SHUFFLES TOWARD THE ROSTRUM WITH THE SHORTEST STEPSPOSSIBLE . WHERE IT TAKES 230 CONSERVATIVES ONLY 15 MINUTES TO VOTE,120 SOCIALISTS CONSUME AS MUCH AS AN HOUR AND A HALF . COW-WALKING ISCOMBINED WITH SITDOWN STRIKES IN DIET CORRIDORS, DELIBERATE TRAFFICJAMS, BOYCOTTS, AND PICKETING TO PREVENT THE SPEAKER FROM TAKING HISSEAT . THROUGH THESE TACTICS, THE SOCIALISTS FORCE ALLNIGHT SESSIONS,HOPING THAT THE WORNOUT GOVERNMENT MEN WILL HAVE TO GIVE IN SOMEWHEREALONG THE LINE . NOT ENOUGH BODIES . THIS YEAR, WITH A BACKLOG OF 66BILLS STILL STALLED IN COMMITTEE, PREMIER IKEDA ORDERED HIS MEN TO PUSHTHEM THROUGH BEFORE THE DIET SESSION CLOSES JULY 6 . WHEN THEGOVERNMENT PARTY RECENTLY USED ITS MAJORITY TO FORCE A VOTE ON ACONTROVERSIAL RELIEF-LAW REVISION, COW-WALKING WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH .FISTS AND ASHTRAYS STARTED TO FLY . BATTLING LAWMAKERS SHOUTED : "RESPECT PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES ! " THE BRAWLING LATER SPREAD TO THECABINET COMMITTEE, WHERE FIVE BILLS WERE STALLED . SOCIALISTS MASSEDAROUND THE COMMITTEEROOM DOOR TO PREVENT CHAIRMAN TADANORI NAGAYAMAFROM ENTERING . A FLYING WEDGE OF BURLY CONSERVATIVE " SECRETARIES "SMASHED THROUGH, CARRYING THE AGING, ANEMIA-WEAKENED CHAIRMAN IN WITHTHEM . AS THE VOTE WAS HURRIEDLY TAKEN, SOCIALISTS SCREAMED " FASCISTDICTATORSHIP ! " AND CHARGED . IN THE MELEE, CHAIRMAN NAGAYAMADISAPPEARED, WAS RESCUED TEN MINUTES LATER BY DIET GUARDS WHO FOUND HIMBRUISED AND BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR . HE WAS RUSHED TO A HOSPITAL . " WEWON'T HAVE ENOUGH BODIES TO GO AROUND IF PEOPLE GET INJURED EVERY TIMEA CONTROVERSIAL BILL COMES UP, " SAID YUTARO TAKEYAMA, HEAD OF THEGOVERNMENT PARTY'S STRATEGY COMMITTEE . " WE WILL JUST HAVE TO APPOINTSTRONGER MEN TO COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIPS, MEN WHO WON'T GET PUT OUT OFACTION EVERY TIME THE GOING GETS ROUGH . /
