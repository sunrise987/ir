BERLIN ONE LAST RUN HANS WEIDNER HAD BEEN HOPING FOR MONTHS TOESCAPE DRAB EAST GERMANY AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE WEST . THE ODDS WEREAGAINST HIM, FOR WEIDNER, 40, WAS A CRIPPLE ON CRUTCHES WHO LIVED INTHE VILLAGE OF NEUGERSDORF, 115 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FRONTIER OFFREEDOM BUT HANS WEIDNER DID HAVE ONE MAJOR ASSET, THE BUS THATHE OPERATED FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNIST REGIME . IT WAS AN UGLY THING, ANDANCIENT . ITS CHASSIS CREAKED, AND THE ENGINE COUGHED ; ACREAM-COLORED COAT OF PAINT COULD NOT DISGUISE THE WELTS AND BRUISES OFTWO DECADES OF CHUGGING SERVICE . IN FACT, THE BUS WAS READY FOR THEJUNK PILE WHEN WEIDNER DECIDED TO PRESS IT INTO SERVICE FOR ONE LASTRUN . SHARP BLADES . THE HAZARDS WOULD BE GREAT ON THE JOURNEY TO THEBORDER ; SO WEIDNER SIGNED UP A FELLOW VILLAGER, JURGEN WAGNER, 22, TOTAKE THE WHEEL . EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE PAIR BEGAN THEFEVERISH PREPARATIONS IN WEIDNER'S GARAGE . FIRST WEIDNER AND WAGNERATTACHED A HEAVY SNOWPLOW TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS, NOT TO PLOW SNOW,BUT TO SCOOP AWAY THE HEAVY OBSTACLES THEY KNEW AWAITED THEM ATROADBLOCKS AHEAD . TO ALL SIX LUGS ON EACH FRONT WHEEL THEY BOLTEDSHARP BLADES OF THE TOUGHEST STEEL, AFFIXED SO THAT THE WHIRLING EDGESWOULD CHOP BARBED WIRE TO BITS . THEN THEY WEDGED ONE-QUARTER-INCHSECTIONS OF STEEL PLATE INSIDE THE BUS TO STOP BULLETS . AT LAST ALLWAS READY . ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WEIDNER AND WAGNER PILED THEIR WIVES ANDFOUR CHILDREN ABOARD, NOT FORGETTING THREE TONS OF HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS. FOR ADDED PROTECTION THE PLOTTERS SHOVELED A TON OF COAL AND POTATOESINTO THE BACK OF THE BUS . THEN THEY CHUGGED OFF NORTH TOWARD BERLINALONG BACK ROADS TO ESCAPE COMMUNIST PATROLS . JUST BEFORE THEY REACHEDTHE WALL, THEY PLANNED TO SWING WEST IN ORDER TO ENTER THE EAST-WESTAUTOBAHN LEADING TO THE U.S . SECTOR OF THE CITY . EN ROUTE, THERADIATOR FROZE IN THE SUBZERO WEATHER . THAT FIXED, THEY WERE ONLY AFEW MILES FARTHER WHEN A TIRE BLEW OUT . THE KIDS WERE CRYING AND THEWIVES SHIVERING WITH COLD AND PANIC WHEN, AT LAST, THEY ARRIVED ATDREWITZ, THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED CHECKPOINT ON THE ENTIRE AUTOBAHN TOBERLIN . IT WAS NO TIME TO STOP AND RECONSIDER . FLYING POTATOES . "WAH-AH, WAH-AH, " SHRIEKED THE POLICE-TYPE KLAXONS THAT WEIDNER HADTHOUGHTFULLY INSTALLED IN ADVANCE . THE COMMUNIST GUARDS OBEDIENTLYRAISED THE FIRST OF THREE BARRIERS . BUT WHAT WAS A BUS DOING ONEMERGENCY DUTY ? SUDDENLY THE SHOOTING BEGAN TOO LATE . WAGNER, AT 40M.P.H., WAS ALREADY CRASHING THROUGH THE SECOND BARRIER 100 YARDSAHEAD, THEN THE THIRD, ONLY 20 YARDS AWAY . ITS WINDSHIELD SMASHED, ITSPASSENGERS SHAKEN, ITS CARGO OF COAL AND POTATOES IN EVERY CORNER OFTHE CAB, THE OLD BUS FINALLY LURCHED TO A STOP A FEW MILES DOWN THEROAD WHERE THE COMMUNISTS NO LONGER MATTERED AT THE U.S .
