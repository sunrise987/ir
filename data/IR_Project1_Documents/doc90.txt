FRANCE THE PERSONAL TOUCH AS OTHER EUROPEANS RAILED AGAINSTCHARLES DE GAULLE'S VISION OF A FRENCH-LED EUROPE, MANY FRENCHMEN LASTWEEK WERE UNEASILY CONTEMPLATING DE GAULLE'S INFLUENCE ON THEIR OWNSOCIETY . SINCE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION TURNED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INTOA VIRTUAL ANNEXE OF THE ELYSEE PALACE, DE GAULLE HAS RULED WITH LITTLEPARLIAMENTARY CRITICISM AND WITH ONLY MUTED RUMBLINGS FROM FRANCE'SONCE RAMBUNCTIOUS PRESS . IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT LE GRAND CHARLES HASESTABLISHED A PERSONAL REGIME IN WHICH, THOUGH IT IS NOT REMOTELY SOAUTOCRATIC A GOVERNMENT AS THAT OF FRANCISCO FRANCO, ALMOST ANYPOTENTIAL CONTROVERSY IS SIMILARLY QUELLED BY THE GOVERNMENT LEST IT BEINTERPRETED ABROAD AS A DIRECT EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL POLICIES . WITHVIRTUALLY UNLIMITED POWERS UNDER FRANCE'S EMERGENCY LAWS, DE GAULLE'SGOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS HAS : CANCELED THE SHOWING OF A TVDOCUMENTARY TO MARK THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF STALINGRAD .PREPARED BY THE STATE-OWNED TV NETWORK, THE FILM INCLUDED A TIRADE BYNIKITA KHRUSHCHEV THAT, IN THE GOVERNMENT'S WORDS, WAS " VIOLENTLYHOSTILE TO WEST GERMANY AND TO THE POLICY OF FRANCO-GERMANRAPPROCHEMENT . " SAME WEEK, ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY MOVIE, DEATH INMADRID, CONSISTING MOSTLY OF STOCK SHOTS TAKEN DURING THE 1936 SPANISHCIVIL WAR, WAS DENIED A LICENSE FOR EXHIBITION IN FRANCE OR ABROADPRESUMABLY FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING FRANCO . ORDERED THE PARIS OPERA TOCANCEL A PERFORMANCE BY RUDOLF NUREYEV, A RUSSIAN BALLET DANCER WHODEFECTED TO THE WEST IN 1961 . THOUGH NUREYEV HAS ALREADY DANCED INPARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT PLAINLY FELT THAT HISAPPEARANCE IN PARIS WOULD BE AN AFFRONT TO NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV .CONFISCATED NEARLY 75,000 COPIES OF A NOVEL, HIGH COURT, IN WHICHRIGHT-WING AUTHOR ALFRED FABRE-LUCE GIVES A FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF AFUTURE TRIAL OF DE GAULLE AS IT MIGHT BE CONDUCTED IF HE WERE IMPEACHEDBY THE SENATE . THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECT THIS TIME WAS TO AVOID OFFENSETO CHARLES DE GAULLE HIMSELF . SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REPRESSIONS AREEXPLICABLE AS INTERNATIONAL BACKSCRATCHING . DE GAULLE'S INCREASINGAMIABILITY TOWARD SPAIN HAS BEEN REWARDED BY FRANCO'S JAILING OF SIXTOP ANTI-GAULLIST TERRORISTS WHO WERE HIDING OUT IN SPAIN . BANNING THESTALINGRAD SHOW MAY JUST POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN REPAID LAST WEEK WHENGERMAN POLICE FAILED TO PREVENT MYSTERIOUS FRENCH AGENTS IN MUNICH FROMKIDNAPING A TOP S.A.O . LEADER, ANTOINE ARGOUD (SEE BELOW) . BUT ITSEEMED UNLIKELY THAT KHRUSHCHEV WOULD CARE GREATLY IF NUREYEV DANCED INPARIS, OR THAT ADENAUER WOULD OBJECT TO BEING DAMNED BY NIKITA ON TV .ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN A GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO CENSURE OR LEGALREDRESS, WHO EXPECTS LOGIC ?
