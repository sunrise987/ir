IRAQ THE MEN OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE THE GREEKS SPENT AHAPPY NIGHT, WITH PLENTY TO EAT, TALKING ABOUT THE STRUGGLE NOW PASTFOR THEY HAD BEEN SEVEN DAYS PASSING THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE KURDS,FIGHTING ALL THE TIME, AND THEY HAD SUFFERED WORSE THINGS AT THE HANDSOF THE KURDS THAN ALL THAT THE KING OF PERSIA, AND HIS GENERAL,TISSAPHERNES, COULD DO TO THEM . ANABASIS OF XENOPHON ENEMIES OF THEKURDS HAVE ALWAYS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT, FROM XENOPHON AND HIS TENTHOUSAND GREEKS IN 400 B.C., THROUGH PERSIANS, MONGOLS, TURKS,CRUSADERS, ARABS AND BRITISH, UP TO THIS YEAR, WHEN THE REGIME OFIRAQ'S KARIM KASSEM WAS BLED WHITE BY THE EFFORT TO CRUSH ONE MOREUPRISING OF THE EVER-REBELLIOUS KURD STRIKE . IN BAGHDAD LAST WEEK, THENEW IRAQI REGIME THAT DEPOSED AND KILLED KASSEM IN FEBRUARY FINALLYFACED UP TO THE ISSUE OF PEACE OR CONTINUED WAR WITH THE KURDISHLEADER, MUSTAFA BARZANI . " THE VERY DAY OF THE REVOLT AGAINST KASSEM,/ SAID AN ANGRY KURDISH REBEL, " THE NEW IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY COMMANDCALLED FOR KURDISH SUPPORT . WITH THE REVOLUTION, THE IRAQI ARMEDFORCES WERE TOTALLY DISORGANIZED, AND WE COULD EASILY HAVE STRUCK DEEPINTO IRAQ . INSTEAD WE ACCEPTED THEIR PROMISES AND HELD OUR FIRE . "WHAT THE KURDS ARE DEMANDING IS REGIONAL AUTONOMY WITH A KURDISHLEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, A PROPORTIONATE SHARE FOR KURDS OFALL REVENUES, OIL ROYALTIES AND FOREIGN AID AND, FINALLY, SPECIALKURDISH ARMY UNITS WITH THE SOLE RIGHT TO GARRISON KURDISTAN . THEIRAQI GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK STIFFLY REJECTED THE KURDISH MEMORANDUM,OFFERING THEM INSTEAD ONLY LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IN A RESTRICTEDMOUNTAIN AREA THAT WOULD HAVE EXCLUDED VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR KURDISHPOPULATION CENTERS . THREE PLAGUES . THE KURDISH HOMELAND BEGINS ABOVEBIBLICAL MOUNT ARARAT AND EXTENDS SOUTH IN A LONG, MOUNTAINOUS LOOP TOTHE PERSIAN GULF (SEE MAP) . BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENTS OF HISTORY ANDTHEIR OWN INABILITY TO UNITE, THE ESTIMATED 6,000,000 KURDS ARE TODAYDIVIDED AMONG FIVE DIFFERENT NATIONS : THE SOVIET UNION, TURKEY,SYRIA, IRAN AND IRAQ . LIKE THE KURDISH LANDSCAPE, THE KURDISHCHARACTER HAS REMAINED CONSTANT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS . MANY KURDS ARETALL, FAIR-SKINNED AND BLUE-EYED . OF LIFE THEY ASK LITTLE MORE THANFLOCKS OF BROAD-TAILED SHEEP, A FINE HORSE, A RIFLE WITH SUFFICIENTCARTRIDGE BANDOLEERS, AND A WOMAN WHO CAN BEAR STRONG SONS . FORGENERATIONS, THE LOWLAND ARAB HAS BEEN TERRORIZED BY THE MOUNTAIN KURD. AN ARAB PROVERB SAYS, " THERE ARE THREE PLAGUES IN THE WORLD : THERAT, THE LOCUST AND THE KURD . " THE KURDS REPLY, " A CAMEL IS NOT ANANIMAL, AND AN ARAB IS NOT A HUMAN BEING . " OF IRAQ'S 7,000,000PEOPLE, AT LEAST 1,500,000 ARE KURDS . THEY LIVE IN THE FOOTHILLS OFTHE ZAGROS MOUNTAINS, AND ARE DIVIDED INTO 22 MAJOR AND 54 MINOR TRIBES. UNLIKE THE ARABS ON THE RIVER PLAINS, THEY ARE HARD-WORKING AND FULLOF BOUNCE . BROAD-SHOULDERED MUSTAFA BARZANI, 60, HAS SPENT MOST OF HISADULT LIFE FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE . AFTER WORLD WAR II, WITH RUSSIANBACKING, BARZANI BECAME MILITARY BOSS OF THE SOVIET-INSPIRED KURDISHPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC IN IRAN AND, WHEN IT COLLAPSED, WAS FOR TWELVE YEARSIN EXILE IN THE SOVIET UNION . THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE RULING SHEIKOF THE BARZAN TRIBE, BARZANI DENIES HE IS A COMMUNIST, BUT ECHOES OTHERKURDISH LEADERS WHO SAY THAT IF WAR BREAKS OUT AGAIN THE KURDS WILL "ACCEPT ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET FROM ANYONE " RUSSIANS INCLUDED . SHOOTON SIGHT . AT WEEK'S END, AS THEIR DELEGATES STILL WRANGLED IN BAGHDAD,BOTH THE KURDISH REBELS AND THE IRAQI ARMY PREPARED FOR THE WORST . THEGOVERNMENT PROCLAIMED A DUSK-TO-DAWN CURFEW AROUND NORTHERN IRAQ'SOILFIELDS, PUMP STATIONS, AIRFIELDS, AND MILITARY DEPOTS, WARNED THATVIOLATORS WOULD BE " SHOT ON SIGHT . " IRAQI TROOPS BLOCKED ALL ROADSLEADING INTO THE ZAGROS MOUNTAINS . NEARLY THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ARMYWAS BUSY BUILDING CONCRETE PILLBOXES AND FORTIFICATIONS COVERING THEMOUNTAIN PASSES . BUT DURING THE CEASE-FIRE THE KURDS WERE NOT IDLE .FOOD HAS BEEN STOCKPILED, ARMS REPLENISHED, AND A STANDING ARMY OF35,000 READIED FOR BATTLE, BACKED BY A RESERVE OF 100,000 . THE REBELSARE BUTTRESSED BY SCORES OF KURDISH OFFICERS WHO DESERTED FROM THEIRAQI ARMY, AND ARE LINKED BY A NETWORK OF 100 CAPTURED FIELD RADIOSETS . BUT AT WEEK'S END, THE GOVERNMENT CALLED FOR MORE NEGOTIATIONSAND PROMISED TO RECONSIDER KURDISH DEMANDS . INTURN, THE KURDS AGREEDTO HOLD UP HOSTILITIES . " WE DON'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY FORSTARTING THE WAR AGAIN, " SAID A KURDISH SPOKESMAN, " BUT WE AND THEGOVERNMENT ARE FAR APART LIKE THE DISTANCE FROM GROUND TO SKY . /
