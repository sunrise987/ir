MIDDLE EAST WHO'SWOOING WHO ? IN CAIRO, PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER ACTED LIKE ANEX-CHAMPION SEEKING A SUCCESSFUL COMEBACK . HE LOST MUCH OF HIS CLAIMFOR THE TITLE OF ARAB LEADERSHIP IN 1961, WHEN AN ARMY COUP WRENCHEDSYRIA FROM ITS SHORT-LIVED MERGER WITH EGYPT IN THE UNITED ARABREPUBLIC . THAT LEFT NASSER WITHOUT A SINGLE ARAB ALLY, AND SURROUNDEDBY SUCH VIRULENT ENEMIES AS IRAQ'S DICTATOR KASSEM AND THE KINGS OFJORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA . THEN CAME LAST MONTH'S IRAQI REVOLUTION ANDTHE OVERTHROW OF KASSEM . NO ONE COULD BLAME EGYPT'S LEADER FOR HARKINGBACK TO OLD DREAMS OF ARAB GRANDEUR, FOR THIS NEW MAN IN BAGHDADPRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF WAS A FORMER NASSER PROTEGE DEDICATED TOPANARAB UNITY . TRIBUTE TO MOTHER . WITH THIS IN MIND, NASSER MOUNTED APLATFORM IN CAIRO'S VAST REPUBLIC SQUARE LAST WEEK TO CELEBRATE THEFIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEFUNCT UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . STRINGS OFRAMADAN LIGHTS OUTLINED THE MOSQUES AND MINARETS, AND A CROWD OF 20,000JAMMED THE SQUARE PROTECTED FROM THE COLD NIGHT AIR BY A SIWAN, A "HALL " ROOFED AND WALLED BY BRIGHTLY COLORED CANVAS . " UNION ! UNION! UNION ! NASSER ! NASSER ! NASSER ! " ROARED THE MOB . WHATIT GOT WAS A LITTLE LESS THAN NASSER HAD HOPED FOR . THE LEADERS OF THEIRAQI DELEGATION TO THE CELEBRATION, DEPUTY PREMIER ALI SALEH SAADI ANDFOREIGN MINISTER TALIB HUSSEIN SHABIB, WERE CORDIAL ENOUGH, BUT THEYWERE FAR FROM SPECIFIC . SAADI DUTIFULLY PAID TRIBUTE TO EGYPT AS THE "MOTHER REPUBLIC " OF THE ARAB WORLD, BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR UNION,HE URGED ONLY A /FRANK RAPPROCHEMENT " BETWEEN CAIRO AND BAGHDAD . WASTHIS ENOUGH SURE, CRIED NASSER IN HIS OWN SPEECH . TODAY, HE DECLARED/ THERE IS A UNITY OF OBJECTIVES BETWEEN THE REVOLUTION IN BAGHDAD ANDTHE REVOLUTION IN CAIRO, " AND " WE DO NOT NEED TREATIES ORCONSTITUTIONAL FORMS TO PROVE THIS UNITY . " JAIL FOR THE DOG . INBAGHDAD, NEW PRESIDENT AREF AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE TOO BUSY LEARNINGHOW TO RUN A COUNTRY TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION . THE SLAIN KASSEM, NOWDUBBED " THE MAD TYRANT, " HAD QUARRELED WITH ALL HIS NEIGHBORS . AREFWAS RESTORING TRADE RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, IMPORTS FROM LEBANON ANDEXPORTS TO LITTLE KUWAIT, THE OIL-RICH PRINCIPALITY KASSEM ONCE TRIEDTO TAKE OVER . TIDYING UP ANOTHER NATIONAL PROBLEM, AREF SENT AHELICOPTER NORTH TO PICK UP TWO DELEGATES OF THE KURDISH REBELS IN THEHOPE THAT HE MIGHT NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE BLOODY CIVIL WAR THAT HASTIED UP HALF THE 75,000-MAN IRAQI ARMY ; HE EVEN MADE FRIENDLYOVERTURES TO THE U.S.-BRITISH CONTROLLED IRAQ PETROLEUM CO., WHICHKASSEM HAD ALIENATED . AS FOR THE COMMUNISTS OF BAGHDAD, THEY WERESTILL GOING INTO JAILS . THE RESULT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SINGLE REDPROPAGANDA BARRAGES SINCE THE REDS CHARGED THE U.S . WITH USING GERMWARFARE IN KOREA . PRAVDA'S CORRESPONDENT CLAIMED, " I SAW TANKS CRUSHWOMEN AND CHILDREN, " AND REPORTED THE " PHYSICAL ANNIHILATION OFHUNDREDS, PERHAPS THOUSANDS, OF IRAQI DEMOCRATS AND PATRIOTS . " THEPRAVDA MAN WENT LOOKING FOR AZIZ SHARIF, A 1962 LENIN PEACE PRIZEWINNERAT THE OFFICE OF THE PEACE PARTISANS LEAGUE (A EUPHEMISM FOR REDMILITIA) . A SOLDIER ON GUARD AT THE OFFICE TOLD HIM, " THAT DOG HASLONG SINCE BEEN JAILED . " THE SOVIET RED CROSS EVEN APPEALED TO THEINTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO HELP PROTECT COMMUNISTS, WHOM IT PREFERREDTO CALL " THE DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS VICTIMIZED BY BLOODY PERSECUTION INIRAQ . " WHEN THE FIRST HECTIC DAYS WERE OVER, THE NOVICES WOULD GETAROUND TO ANSWERING GAMAL ABDEL NASSER'S CRY FOR UNION . AT WEEK'S ENDIRAQ'S THINKING WAS SUMMED UP BY FOREIGN MINISTER SHAHIB, WHO PROPOSEDA JOINT MEETING OF THE FOUR " LIBERATED " ARAB STATES (IRAQ, EGYPT,YEMEN, ALGERIA) TO " COORDINATE WORK AMONG THEM IN VARIOUS FIELDS WITHA UNIONIST REVOLUTIONARY AND SOCIALIST TENDENCY .
