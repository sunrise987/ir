ESPIONAGE MIDSUMMER DRAGNET THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LAST WEEK,SECRET AGENTS WERE ON THE MOVE MANY OF THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF JAIL .THE U.S . HAD JUST ROUNDED UP ITS FOURTH OF JULY CATCH ; WEST GERMANYWAS TRYING THREE SPIES WHO HAD PENETRATED ITS SUPPOSEDLY IMPENETRABLEGEHLEN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) ; AND BRITAINHAD TWO SPY THRILLERS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY . DEFEATED MACHINERY . ONTRIAL IN LONDON, ITALIAN-BORN ATOMIC PHYSICIST GIUSEPPE MARTELLI TRIEDTO EXPLAIN AWAY HIS POSSESSION OF HOLLOW-HEELED SHOES SUITABLE FORCONCEALING MICROFILM, CIGARETTE PACKS CONTAINING THIN, INFLAMMABLEMESSAGE PADS, SHEETS OF RENDEZVOUS INSTRUCTIONS, A HIGH-POWERED CAMERA,AND A SUPER-STRENGTH RADIO RECEIVER . HE HAD ACCEPTED ALL THESE GADGETSFROM THE RUSSIANS, HE SAID, ONLY TO STRING THEM ALONG AND THEN DENOUNCETHEM AT THE RIGHT TIME TO THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES . ASKED THE JUDGE :/ YOU FELT THAT YOU COULD DEFEAT THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF SOVIETINTELLIGENCE ? " AND, ALSO IN LONDON, ONE OF THE ODDEST OF THE SPYCASES CAME TO LIGHT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ADMITTED THAT IT WAS GRANTINGASYLUM TO ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN, A FORMER SENIOR RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCEOFFICER WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST 18 MONTHS AGO, AND HAD SPENT THEINTERVENING TIME BEING THOROUGHLY PUMPED BY U.S . AND BRITISH AGENTS .ONE REPORTED RESULT : THE REVELATION THAT BRITISH NEWSMAN H.A.R .PHILBY WAS INDEED THE " THIRD MAN " WHO ENABLED SPIES BURGESS ANDMACLEAN TO ESCAPE ARREST AND FLEE TO RUSSIA IN 1951 . LAST WINTERPHILBY, TOO, SLIPPED BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN JUST AHEAD OF PURSUINGMI-5 AGENTS . ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE QUITE A SHOW OF ASKINGTHE BRITISH PRESS NOT TO PRINT THE STORY, THE AUTHORITIES HAD IN FACTLEAKED IT . LABORITES CHARGED THAT THIS POSSIBLY ENDANGERED DOLNYTSIN,WHO IS SOMEWHERE IN A BRITISH HIDEOUT, AND THAT DOLNYTSIN WAS BEINGUNVEILED NOW BY MACMILLAN'S GOVERNMENT IN THE HOPE OF CLAIMING A SPYSUCCESS AFTER SO MANY SECURITY DISASTERS . FINGERED SPIES . SO MANY REDSPIES ARE CAUGHT, PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OF THEMAROUND. THE U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT THE COMMUNISTNATIONS EMPLOY MORE THAN 300,000 TRAINED AGENTS, WHO ARE HELPED INTHEIR PRYING BY THE " LEGAL " SPIES ATTACHED TO THE 46 SOVIET EMBASSIESAND LEGATIONS IN THE FREE WORLD . (THE U.S . OPERATES WITH A CRACKCORPS OF AGENTS ONLY ABOUT ONE-FIFTH AS LARGE.) BUT WHY WERE SO MANYRED SPIES COMING TO LIGHT AT ONCE ? WHENEVER ONE GREAT POWER HAS ABIG ESPIONAGE ROUNDUP, AS RUSSIA DID LAST MAY IN THE TRIAL OF RUSSIANSCIENTIST OLEG PENKOVSKY, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A LONGTIME WESTERNAGENT, SPIES ELSEWHERE BRACE THEMSELVES FOR A PERIOD OF ROUGH WEATHER .FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A SEASONAL FACTOR INVOLVED ; SUMMER IS THETRADITIONAL TIME TO PUT THE FINGER ON SPIES . AROUND THE END OF JUNE,MANY COMMUNIST " DIPLOMATS " PREPARE TO GO HOME FOR VACATIONS AND NEWINSTRUCTIONS . HAVING HAD AN EYE ON THEM ALREADY, THE FBI THEN OFTENDECIDES TO POUNCE AND EXPOSE THEM BEFORE THEY CAN BE REASSIGNED .NATIVE PASSION . ONE FACT TO EMERGE FROM THE RECENT WAVE OF ARRESTS ISTHAT THE SOVIET APPARATUS SEEMS SENTIMENTALLY FOND OF SUCH OLDCLOAK-AND-DAGGER STANDBYS AS FALSE BOTTOMS IN VALISES, HIDDENCOMPARTMENTS IN TALCUM-POWDER CANS AND TOOTHPASTE TUBES, ANDFLASHLIGHTS WITH MESSAGE CHAMBERS INSTEAD OF BATTERIES . A RUSSIANSPY'S RESIDENCE USUALLY HAS AS MANY TRAP DOORS, HOLLOW BEAMS, FALSEWALLS, SECRET PASSAGES AND DOUBLE- AND TRIPLE-LOCKED DOORS AS A GRADE BHORROR MOVIE . ACTUALLY, AGENTS BOTH EAST AND WEST HAVE BENEFITEDENORMOUSLY FROM FAR MORE MODERN DEVICES . IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TOEAVESDROP ON A CONVERSATION HELD IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMPTY PRAIRIE BYSIMPLY POINTING A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM 500 YARDS AWAY . NEW CAMERAS CANTAKE PICTURES IN TOTAL DARKNESS WITHOUT THE USE OF INFRA-RED LIGHT .FINELY GROUND LENSES CAN ZOOM IN FROM BLOCKS AWAY TO PICK UP THE FINEPRINT ON AN INSURANCE POLICY . BUT THE SOVIETS LIKE THE MOREOLD-FASHIONED AND ROMANTIC GADGETS, MOSTLY, IT SEEMS, FROM A NATIVEPASSION FOR MELODRAMA .RECENTLY NABBED RED AGENTS INCLUDE SWEDEN'S EX-MILITARYATTACHE STIG WENNERSTROM ; RUSSIA'S IVAN EGEROV AND WIFE, ATTACHED TOTHE U.N . SECRETARIAT ; TWO UNIDENTIFIED RUSSIANS CAUGHT IN WASHINGTONUSING THE NAMES AND PAPERS OF INNOCENT LIVING AMERICANS, AS WELL AS ABRITISH CORPORAL, A FRENCH NAVAL RESERVIST, A UMAN AND HALF A DOZENRUSSIAN,  RUMANIAN AND CZECH DIPLOMATS .
