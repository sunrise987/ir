COMMUNISTS NOW FOR THE MAIN EVENT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAD MOREREASONS LAST WEEK TO WONDER WHY HE EVER INVITED A RED CHINESEDELEGATION TO MOSCOW . TWENTY-FIVE REASONS, TO BE EXACT, ALL NEATLYNUMBERED IN A LETTER FOR CONVENIENT " POINT-BY-POINT DISCUSSION " ATTHE SCHEDULED SINO-SOVIET MEETING NEXT WEEK . MAO TSE-TUNG'S LATESTMESSAGE TO NIKITA THE MOST VEHEMENT TO DATE IN THE CONTINUING QUARRELDOOMED THE CONFRONTATION TO FAILURE BEFORE IT BEGAN . PEKINGDELIBERATELY LEFT THE KREMLIN NO ROOM FOR COMPROMISE . AFTER YEARS OFDISCUSSION OVER WHETHER THE SPLIT WAS REAL, WESTERN SKEPTICS COULD NOLONGER DOUBT THAT IT WAS DEEP, JAGGED, AND UNBRIDGEABLE FOR A LONG TIMETO COME . PARROT & STICK . IN 24,000 BRAZENLY CONTEMPTUOUS WORDS, MAOACCUSED KHRUSHCHEV OF SPAWNING A NEW PERSONALITY CULT WORSE THANSTALIN'S, ASSAILED THE KREMLIN FOR " GREAT POWER CHAUVINISM ANDECONOMIC PRESSURE " AGAINST OTHER RED NATIONS, CHARGED THE SOVIETS WITHTRYING TO PURGE FOREIGN COMMUNIST PARTIES . EXCLAIMED RED CHINA : "WHAT IS ALL THIS IF NOT SUBVERSION ? " AT THE SAME TIME, PEKING WASNOT ABOVE ATTEMPTING SOME SUBVERSION OF ITS OWN . APPEALING TO MOSCOW'SEAST EUROPEAN SATELLITES, THE STATEMENT DECLARED : " IF A PARTY CANNOTUSE ITS BRAINS TO THINK FOR ITSELF, BUT INSTEAD IS A PARTY THAT PARROTSTHE WORDS OF OTHERS, RUNS HITHER AND THITHER IN RESPONSE TO THE BATONOF CERTAIN PERSONS ABROAD, SUCH A PARTY IS INCAPABLE OF LEADING THEMASSES . " THE CRUX OF THE CHINESE DISPUTE WITH RUSSIA REMAINEDMOSCOW'S PROPAGANDA LINE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH THE WEST . THISPOLICY, SAID PEKING SCORNFULLY, WAS PLUCKED OUT OF " SOME MYSTICAL BOOKFROM HEAVEN " ; MOREOVER, THOSE WHO DARE TO DISAGREE ARE TREATED " ASHERETICS DESERVING TO BE BURNED AT THE STAKE . HOW CAN THE CHINESECOMMUNISTS AGREE ? THEY CANNOT . IT IS IMPOSSIBLE . " AS ALWAYS,PEKING STUCK TO THE DOGMA THAT THE ROAD TO VIOLENT REVOLUTION INAFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA WAS THE ONLY PATH A TRUE MARXIST COULDFOLLOW . AS FOR SOVIET CHARGES OF WARMONGERING, THE RED CHINESE REPLIEDWITH AN ARGUMENT THAT, IRONICALLY, ECHOED SOME PENTAGON STRATEGISTS .BRUSH-FIRE WARS, DECLARED PEKING, NEED NOT NECESSARILY ESCALATE INTO ANALL-OUT NUCLEAR STRUGGLE . TRUTH WAS, DECLARED THE MANIFESTO, THERUSSIANS WERE TOO SELFISH AND SCARED TO RISK THEIR BOURGEOIS GAINS INFAR-OFF BATTLES . " TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, " SAID RED CHINA, " WHOEVERCONSIDERS THAT A REVOLUTION CAN BE MADE ONLY IF EVERYTHING IS PLAINSAILING, ONLY IF THERE IS AN ADVANCE GUARANTEE AGAINST FAILURE, ISCERTAINLY NOT A REVOLUTIONARY . " KEEP TALKING . PEKING'S PUNCH WASNEATLY TIMED TO CATCH THE KREMLIN OFF BALANCE . IT LANDED ON THE EVE OFA SPECIAL CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING CALLED TO DISCUSS RUSSIA'S INTERNALIDEOLOGICAL TROUBLES . FOR FOUR DAYS THE RUSSIANS WERE STUNNED ANDSPEECHLESS . FINALLY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ANGRILY ANNOUNCED THAT ITWOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER TO PUBLISH RED CHINA'S " DISTORTED, UNWARRANTEDATTACK . " CHINESE COMMUNIST NEWSPAPERS TRIUMPHANTLY HEADLINED RUSSIA'SREFUSAL TO PRINT THE CHINESE DOCUMENT . EVEN RUSSIA'S VAUNTED SPACEFEATS WERE NOTHING THAT NIKITA COULD TAKE CREDIT FOR . " DURING THESTALIN ERA HE WAS A THIRDOR EVEN FOURTH-RATE MAN, " THE NEWSPAPERREPORTED . " HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH NUCLEAR AND SPACE DEVELOPMENTS ./ IN RUSSIA'S OWN BAILIWICK, THE CHINESE REDS ALSO STAYED ON THEOFFENSIVE . COMMUNIST RUMANIA, WHICH HAS BEEN FEUDING WITH THE KREMLINOVER MOSCOW'S INTERFERENCE IN ITS ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, GLEEFULLY PUBLISHEDA LENGTHY SUMMARY OF THE RED CHINESE INDICTMENT . PEKING'S EMBASSY INMOSCOW BOLDLY DISTRIBUTED RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE COPIES OF ITS MANIFESTO .CALLERS WERE GREETED BY AN ATTACHE, AND AFTER A POLITE CHAT OVER TEA,GOT AS MANY TRANSLATIONS OF THE 63-PAGE DOCUMENT AS THEY WANTED .
