GREAT BRITAIN WOOING THE MIDDLE CLASS WHEN 244 LABOR MEMBERS OFPARLIAMENT VOTED SECRETLY LAST WEEK TO NAME A NEW LABOR PARTY LEADER,THEY DID SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ELEVEN YEARS WITH SOME CONFIDENCETHAT THEY MIGHT ALSO BE PICKING BRITAIN'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER . THEPROSPECT SEEMED TO HAVE INFLUENCED THE VOTING CONSIDERABLY . IN THEFIRST ROUND OF ELECTING A SUCCESSOR TO THE LATE HUGH GAITSKELL, HAROLDWILSON, 46, LAST WEEK WON AN UNEXPECTEDLY HANDSOME LEAD OVER HIS TWOOPPONENTS . HE GOT 115 VOTES ; GAITSKELL'S DEPUTY, ACTING LEADERGEORGE BROWN, AN EARLY FAVORITE, GOT 88 ; AND A THIRD CANDIDATE, JAMESCALLAGHAN, WHO WAS AUTOMATICALLY ELIMINATED, GOT 41 . ONLY EIGHT VOTESSHORT OF THE OUTRIGHT MAJORITY NEEDED FOR VICTORY ON THE FIRST BALLOT,WILSON BECAME AN ODDS-ON FAVORITE TO DEFEAT BROWN IN THIS WEEK'S RUNOFF. IN VOTING FOR PORTLY, PIPE-PUFFING WILSON, A ONETIME OXFORD DON WHODRAWS MOST OF HIS SUPPORT FROM THE LEFT AND WAS ONE OF HUGH GAITSKELL'SARCHRIVALS, LABOR M.P.S APPARENTLY HAD IN MIND NOT HIS RUTHLESSOPPORTUNISM BUT THE FACT THAT HE, LIKE GAITSKELL, IS A MIDDLE-CLASSINTELLECTUAL . BY CONTRAST WITH EARTHY GEORGE BROWN, A BLUNT, DILIGENTANTI-COMMUNIST WITH STRONG UNION SUPPORT, MANY LABORITES BELIEVE THATHAROLD WILSON WILL HAVE MORE APPEAL FOR MIDDLE-CLASS VOTERS, WHOHAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY DISENCHANTED WITH PRIME MINISTER HAROLDMACMILLAN . AN EFFECTIVE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF TRADE FOR 3F YEARS IN THELAST LABOR GOVERNMENT, WILSON, AT 31,WAS THE YOUNGEST CABINET MINISTERAPPOINTED IN 165 YEARS .
