CONGO READING THE RUSSIANS' MAIL A COUPLE OF SOVIET DIPLOMATSGOT THE KIND OF TREATMENT IN THE CONGO LAST WEEK THAT MANY OTHERCOUNTRIES HAVE OFTEN WISHED BUT NOT DARED TO METE OUT TO RED ENVOYS .ALMOST FROM THE DAY OF THE CONGO'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1960, THE RUSSIANSAND THEIR SATELLITES WORKED DOGGEDLY TO DESTROY WHAT LITTLE STABILITYTHE COUNTRY HAD IN HOPES OF GETTING A COMMUNIST FACTION IN CONTROL .EXPELLED EN MASSE AFTER THE DEMISE OF ERRATIC PATRICE LUMUMBA, THE REDSBEGAN FILTERING BACK INTO LEOPOLDVILLE LAST YEAR, NOTABLY TO THETOWERING EIGHT-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING THAT IS BOTH EMBASSY ANDRESIDENCE FOR SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI NEMCHINA AND HIS 100-MAN STAFFOF OPERATIVES . TWO OF NEMCHINA'S MOST IMPORTANT AIDES, HIS SLIM, FAIREMBASSY COUNSELOR BORIS VORONIN AND STOCKY, BUSHY-HAIRED PRESS ATTACHEYURI MIAKOTNYKH, HAVE DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY CLOSE CONTACTS WITHEXTREMISTS OPPOSED TO PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA'S MODERATE REGIME .MIAKOTNYKH WORKED HARD TO PENETRATE THE TRADE UNIONS AND LEFTWINGSTUDENT GROUPS, EVEN LOBBIED IN THE CORRIDORS OF PARLIAMENT . TUG OFWAR . WHAT WORRIED THE GOVERNMENT MOST WAS THE CLOSE CONTACT OF THE TWORUSSIANS WITH A PLOTTING EXILE GROUP LED BY LUMUMBA'S FORMER PARTYCHIEF CHRISTOPHE GBENYE, WHO MADE HIS HEADQUARTERS ACROSS THE CONGORIVER IN THE EX-FRENCH CONGO CAPITAL OF BRAZZAVILLE . ONE DAY LASTWEEK, WHEN VORONIN AND MIAKOTNYKH DROVE DOWN TO THE RIVER BANK, KNOWNAS " LE BEACH, " FOR THE FERRY RIDE OVER TO BRAZZAVILLE, ADOULA'S COPSDECIDED TO STOP THEM ON THE WAY BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN UPTO . SURROUNDING THEIR CAR AT THE LANDING STAGE, CONGOLESE POLICEINSISTED ON A SEARCH . WITH A SHRUG, THE RUSSIANS OPENED THE TRUNK,THEN LET THEM LOOK IN THE FRONT AND BACK SEATS . BUT VORONIN WASCLEARLY DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE UP HIS BRIEFCASE, AND HUGGED IT TO HISCHEST AS HE AND MIAKOTNYKH GOT BACK INTO THE CAR . TO MAKE SURE THERUSSIANS DID NOT TRY TO START THE ENGINE AND SPEED AWAY, THE POLICE LETTHE AIR OUT OF THEIR TIRES, THEN PULLED OPEN THE DOORS AND BEGAN A TUGOF WAR WITH VORONIN'S LEGS, YANKING HIS SHOES OFF IN THE PROCESS . ASTHEY PULLED, MIAKOTNYKH CLUNG JUST AS FIERCELY TO VORONIN, UNTIL ATLAST, BOTH MEN WERE DRAGGED OUT FEET FIRST, RELIEVED OF THE BRIEFCASEAND HEAVED UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO A PICKUP TRUCK . WHEN ONE OF THERUSSIANS TRIED TO STUFF A DOCUMENT INSIDE HIS SHIRT, A CONGOLESE GUARDRIPPED THE ENTIRE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT OFF . OUT IN THE RAIN . WITH THAT,THE PRISONERS WERE DRIVEN OFF TO A MILITARY CAMP OUTSIDE LEOPOLDVILLE,AND THE CONTENTS OF VORONIN'S BRIEFCASE WERE TAKEN TO POLICEHEADQUARTERS . SURE ENOUGH, CLAIMED THE GOVERNMENT, AMONG THEM WAS ALETTER FROM GBENYE TO THE RUSSIANS ASKING FOR 5 BILLION IN COUNTERFEITCONGOLESE FRANCS TO BE USED TO UNDERMINE THE CONGO'S CURRENCY, ANDANOTHER DOCUMENT REQUESTING ARMS, TAPE RECORDS AND " OTHER ESPIONAGEEQUIPMENT . " ONE OF THE LETTERS BORE TEETH MARKS, AS IF A RUSSIAN HADTRIED TO SWALLOW IT . TO PUT AN ABRUPT STOP TO SUCH SOVIET ACTIVITIES,SQUADS OF CONGOLESE POLICE WERE RUSHED TO CORDON OFF THE RUSSIANS'APARTMENTS, AND INSIDE, THE RUSSIANS SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THEMSELVESWITHOUT TELEPHONE SERVICE AND WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHICH MEANT THEYWOULD HAVE TO SWELTER IN THE HEAT WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONERS AND DOWITHOUT COOKSTOVES . TWO CZECH DIPLOMATS WHO DROVE UP TO THE GATE WEREARRESTED AND FORCED TO STAND OUTSIDE MOST OF THE NIGHT IN A TROPICALDOWNPOUR . FROM MOSCOW CAME AN ANGRY DEMAND FOR THE RELEASE OF THEPRISONERS, WHO, ACCORDING TO IZVESTIA, HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY POLICE LEDBY " AMERICAN ADVISERS . " IGNORING THE PROTEST, ADOULA'S AGENTS NEXTMORNING SWOOPED DOWN ON THE HOTEL ROOM OF ANOTHER SUSPECTED COMMUNISTTROUBLEMAKER, THE NEWLY ARRIVED CORRESPONDENT OF THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCYNOVISTI, HUSTLED HIM OFF TO A CELL . HE WAS LATER RELEASED, BUT BYWEEK'S END, THE TWO RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS WERE PUT ABOARD EUROPE-BOUNDPLANES . USUALLY HESITANT PREMIER ADOULA REJECTED HIS CABINET'SRECOMMENDATION THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIABE SEVERED . BUT HE DID ORDER AMBASSADOR NEMCHINA TO GET OUT OF THECONGO WITHIN 24 HOURS AND TAKE THE ENTIRE 100-MAN STAFF WITH HIM .
