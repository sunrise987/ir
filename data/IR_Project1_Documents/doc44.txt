EGYPT SURPRISE AT SUEZ WHEN EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSERGRABBED THE SUEZ CANAL 6F YEARS AGO, HIS BITTER ENEMIES IN EUROPEPREDICTED THAT THE BIG DITCH WOULD SOON BE FILLED WITH SILT AND THATUNTRAINED EGYPTIAN PILOTS WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO STEER SHIPPING THROUGHSAFELY . THE CRITICS TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS . EGYPT HASWIDENED THE CANAL WITH BYPASSES PERMITTING THREE CONVOYS DAILY TO USETHE WATERWAY MORE EFFICIENTLY, AND DEEPENED IT SUFFICIENTLY TOACCOMMODATE MOST OF THE WORLD'S TANKER FLEET . LAST YEAR 18,518 SHIPSTRAVELED THROUGH THE CANAL, 370 MORE THAN IN 1961 . FURTHER PLANS CALLFOR ADDITIONAL DEEPENING OF THE CANAL, AND MAKING IT TWO-WAY FOR ITSENTIRE 102-MILE LENGTH . FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF THE OLD SUEZ CANAL CO .WERE FIRMLY CONVINCED IN 1956 THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GET A CENT OUT OFTHEIR NATIONALIZED INVESTMENT . BUT WITH 1962 REVENUE AT A WHOPPING$149.5 MILLION (45 PER CENT ABOVE 1955), NASSER'S CANAL OFFICIALS HAVEANNOUNCED PAYMENT OF THE FINAL $11.4 MILLION INSTALLMENT ON THE $81.2MILLION COMPENSATION DEBT . RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CANAL'S SUCCESS IS ITSEGYPTIAN BOSS, DYNAMIC, BALDING MAHMOUD YOUNIS, 50, A ONETIME ARMYENGINEER AND A CLOSE FRIEND OF NASSER SINCE THE DAYS WHEN THEY SHAREDAN OFFICE AT THE STAFF OFFICERS COLLEGE, EGYPT'S WEST POINT . THOUGHYOUNIS HAD NEVER SAILED SO MUCH AS A ROWBOAT, NASSER PICKED HIM TO RUNTHE BUSY WATERWAY SHORTLY AFTER THE BRITISH AND FRENCH SHIP PILOTSWITHDREW FROM THE CANAL IN SEPTEMBER 1956 . AT FIRST, YOUNIS HADAVAILABLE ONLY 26 TRAINED PILOTS OF THE 250 NORMALLY REQUIRED, BUT HEKEPT THE CANAL FUNCTIONING AROUND THE CLOCK . " I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHINGABOUT SHIPS, " HE SAID . " BUT I DID KNOW A LOT ABOUT MOVEMENT CONTROLFROM THE ARMY . KEEPING THE SHIPS SHUTTLING BACK AND FORTH WAS A SIMPLEMATTER COMPARED WITH ORGANIZING A BATTLE . " YOUNIS TAKES GREAT PRIDEIN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS EGYPTIAN PILOTS . " THEY THOUGHT THAT ONLYEUROPEANS COULD RUN THE CANAL, BUT THEY WERE WRONG, " HE SAYS . " IHAVE NO INFERIORITY COMPLEXES . TO ME, MANAGEMENT IS A SCIENCE THATANYONE CAN MASTER . " U.S . SHIPPERS ARE FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THEEFFICIENT SERVICE THEY GET IN YOUNIS' CANAL . TO THEM, HE SHRUGS, " INTHE U.S., YOU SAY THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT . WELL, THAT'S WHAT ISAY TOO . AND YOU ARE MY CUSTOMERS . "
