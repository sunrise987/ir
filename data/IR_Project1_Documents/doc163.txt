JORDAN CLOUDBURST AT PETRA JOHN WILLIAM BURGON, A 19TH CENTURYBRITISH CLERGYMAN AND MINOR POET, WROTE A MEMORABLE LINE WHEN HEDESCRIBED ANCIENT PETRA AS " A ROSE-RED CITY HALF AS OLD AS TIME . "ROMANTIC, INACCESSIBLE, IT LIES IN THE MIDST OF A VAST DESERT INSOUTHERN JORDAN, AND TODAY, AS ALWAYS, ITS ONLY APPROACH IS THROUGH ADEEP, NARROW GORGE CALLED THE SIQ, WHICH TRADITION SAYS WAS CREATEDWHEN MOSES STRUCK THE ROCK WITH HIS ROD . FROM 300 B.C . TO A.D . 100,WHEN PETRA FLOURISHED AS THE CARAVAN CAPITAL OF THE NABATAEANS, THE SIQMADE THE CITY IMPREGNABLE, SINCE A FEW MEN IN THE SERPENTINE GORGE,OFTEN NO MORE THAN TWO YARDS WIDE, COULD HOLD UP AN ARMY . TODAY, THENARROW THREE-MILE COURSE IS TRAVELED BY THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS WHO GO TOGAPE AT THE ELABORATE TOMBS AND TEMPLES BUILT INTO ROCK THAT IS COLOREDCRIMSON, SEPIA, BROWN AND VIOLET, LIKE WATERED SILK . DESERT SPRINKLE .TWO PARTIES OF FOREIGNERS REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE SIQ ONE DAY LASTWEEK, EAGER TO JOURNEY THE REMAINING THREE MILES TO PETRA . THE FIRSTWAS A GROUP OF 23 FRENCHWOMEN MAKING A HOLY LAND PILGRIMAGE UNDER THETUTELAGE OF A PARISIAN PRIEST, ABBE JEAN STEINMANN, 52, VICAR OF NOTREDAME ;  THE SECOND WAS A LARGER GROUP OF ITALIAN PILGRIMS . THEFRENCH PARTY GAILY ENTERED THE SIQ GORGE JUST AS A SPRINKLE OF RAINBEGAN TO FALL . FOUR WERE TRAVELING IN A LANDROVER, THE REST ON FOOT .SUDDENLY, THE LIGHT RAIN BECAME A CLOUDBURST THE WORST IN ARID PETRA'SRECORDED HISTORY . WITHIN HALF AN HOUR, TORRENTIAL FLOODS WERESTREAMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS AND CLIFFS AND POURING INTO THE SIQ ASINTO A FUNNEL . ONE ITALIAN PILGRIM SAID, " WE HEARD SHRIEKS AND CRIESWITHIN THE RAVINE, AS THE MUDDY CASCADE OF WATER RUSHED BY US . WE SAWTHE LITTLE CAR WITH THE FOUR WOMEN AND THE DRIVER SWEPT ALONG BY THETORRENT AND THEN SUBMERGED . IN AN INSTANT, THEY ALL DISAPPEARED IN THEFLOODWATERS RAGING ALONG AT PERHAPS 60 MILES AN HOUR . " PRAYERS ON THELEDGE . TWO YOUNG FRENCHWOMEN, WHO WERE DAWDLING ALONG BEHIND THEPARTY, HEARD THE ROAR OF THE ONCOMING FLOOD AND MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE UPTHE ROCK WALL TO A LEDGE 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND . " THE WATER ROSEHIGHER AND HIGHER, " SAID ONE . " IT GRADUALLY REACHED OUR FEET, THENOUR KNEES . WE COULD NOT SEE THE OTHERS, BUT WE HEARD THEIR CRIES .SOON WE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE THUNDERING WATER . WE CLUNG TO THE LEDGEAND PRAYED . " THOSE TWO WERE SAVED, BUT WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDED THREEHOURS LATER, THE MUDDY FLOOR OF THE GORGE WAS LITTERED WITH SODDEN,BATTERED BODIES ABBE STEINMANN, TWO ARABS (A GUIDE AND A DRIVER), AND21 FRENCHWOMEN . PETRA POLICE FLASHED WORD OF THE DISASTER TO AMMANAND, DROPPING EVERYTHING, KING HUSSEIN FLEW HIS HELICOPTER TO THE SIQGORGE AND PERSONALLY DIRECTED OPERATIONS . THE TWO SURVIVORS WERERUSHED TO COMFORTABLE QUARTERS IN HUSSEIN'S BASMAN PALACE . THE 22OTHERS, WHO NEVER QUITE REACHED THE ROSE-RED TOMBS OF PETRA, WEREEMBALMED FOR AIR SHIPMENT AND BURIAL AT HOME IN FRANCE .A FAMED BIBLICAL SPECIALIST, ABBE STEINMANNWROTE SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE PROPHETS, BUT IN 1961 HIS LIFE OF JESUS WASPLACED ON THE VATICAN'S INDEX OF BANNED WORKS, AND A YEAR LATER THECHURCH FORBADE HIM ANY FURTHER BIBLICAL PUBLICATIONS .
