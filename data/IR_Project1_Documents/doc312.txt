WEST GERMANY THE OLDEST GRAD THE TALL, GANGLING YOUTH WITH THEKAISER WILHELM MUSTACHE WAS A MODEL OF SELF-DISCIPLINE AT THEUNIVERSITY OF FREIBURG . LIMITED TO A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE OF $21,HE WAS NEVER KNOWN TO SQUANDER OR BORROW A PFENNIG . AT NIGHT, NODDINGOVER HIS LAW BOOKS, HE WOULD TAKE OFF HIS SHOES AND SOCKS, IMMERSE HISFEET IN A TUB OF COLD WATER TO STAY AWAKE . HE NEVER FOUGHT A DUEL, BUTHE WAS NO SQUARE . HE PLEDGED A FRATERNITY, ACQUIRED THE " BIERNAME "(DRINKING NICKNAME) OF " TONI, " AND AT FROTHY FUNCTIONS WOULD BANG HISSTEIN ON AN OAK TABLE IN UNISON WITH THE REST OF THEM . LATER, INCOLOGNE, HE DAZZLED THE FRAULEINS AT THE LOCAL PUDELNASS (SOPPING WET)TENNIS CLUB . AMONG THOSE WHO KNEW HIM, MANY WERE SURPRISED WHEN KONRADADENAUER (CLASS OF 1897) GREW UP TO BE A POLITICIAN AND EVENTUALLYCHANCELLOR OF WEST GERMANY .

FREE ! ) . SAID DER ALTE : " WHEN A STUDENT ENTERS THEUNIVERSITY, HE OR SHE IS NEITHER A FINISHED MAN NOR A FINISHED WOMAN .ONE IS NEVER COMPLETELY FINISHED IN LIFE . A BOY NEEDS A SPECIALATMOSPHERE . IT IS LIKE A PLANT THAT GROWS UP, OR A YOUNG TREE . ITDEPENDS ON HOW THE AIR IS, ON THE SURROUNDINGS HE IS IN, ON THE EARTHTHAT GIVES HIM NOURISHMENT . I BELIEVE A STUDENTENKORPORATION(FRATERNITY) CAN GIVE A YOUNG STUDENT A GREAT DEAL . I LOOK BACK AT MYSTUDENT TIME AND CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH I FOUND IN THEFRATERNITIES HAS AFFECTED ME FOR MY WHOLE LIFE . THE STUDENT CAN ONLYBE RAISED BY THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS PEERS . " AS FOR THE BURGEONINGREVIVAL OF FRATERNITIES SINCE WORLD WAR II (40 PER CENT OF WEST GERMANSTUDENTS NOW BELONG), DER ALTE MAINTAINED THAT " AFTER THE TERRIBLECOLLAPSE AT THE END OF THE WAR, THE RISE OF SUCH A TRADITION IS OF VERYVITAL AND GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ALL THE GERMAN PEOPLE . "     AFTERHIS SPEECH, ADENAUER TOOK TIME TO INSPECT THE SPECIAL OFFICES IN BONN'SPARLIAMENT BUILDING THAT ARE BEING MADE READY FOR HIM TO OCCUPY AFTERHIS OFTPOSTPONED BUT NOW FIRMLY PROMISED RETIREMENT AS CHANCELLOR THISFALL .
