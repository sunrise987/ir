WESTERN EUROPE THE UNVISIT ARRIVING IN BONN JUST 13 DAYS AFTERPRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRIUMPHANT VISIT, CHARLES DE GAULLE MADE NO EFFORTTO ENTER A POPULARITY CONTEST . BOTH FRENCH AND GERMANS LEGITIMATELYEMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO-DAY TRIP WAS ONLY A " WORKING VISIT " ASSTIPULATED BY THE BRAND-NEW FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY . AS FAR ASPROTOCOL AND THE PUBLIC WERE CONCERNED, IT WAS EVEN A KIND OF UNVISITNO PARADES, NO CROWDS . THE BONN PRESS PREDICTED THAT DE GAULLE WOULDTRY TO WHIP THE GERMANS INTO LINE IN CASE THEY HAD GOT TOO FRIENDLYTOWARD THE U.S . HE WAS NOT AS CRUDE AS THAT . BUT HE HAD BEEN STUNG BYKENNEDY'S FRANKFURT SPEECH ABOUT ATLANTIC UNITY (ALTHOUGH DISMISSING ITAS " SALADE, SALADE, SALADE " ), AND DE GAULLE OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO FINDOUT IN BONN IF THE GERMANS HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED BY IT TOMOVE AWAY FROM THE FRANCO-GERMAN ALLIANCE . ANSWER : THE GERMANS WEREJUST ABOUT STANDING STILL . THEY CHIDED DE GAULLE AND HIS TOP MINISTERSFOR THE ANNOUNCED WITHDRAWAL OF FRENCH NAVAL UNITS FROM THE NATO FLEETBUT DID NOT PRESS HIM ON THE QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S EVENTUAL ADMISSIONTO THE COMMON MARKET . THERE WAS SOME HAGGLING ON AGRICULTURE ;BECAUSE OF A PRICE-DEPRESSING AGRICULTURAL SURPLUS, WHICH CAUSED FARMRIOTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE LAST WEEK, THE FRENCH HAD JUST CLOSED THEIRBORDERS TO IMPORTS OF TOMATOES AND APRICOTS, WITHOUT NOTIFYING THECOMMON MARKET . THE ONLY REALLY SUBSTANTIVE AGREEMENT : A MASSIVEYOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM . AMONG OTHER THINGS, DE GAULLE WANTED TO GET TOKNOW VICE CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD, THE MAN WHO WILL TAKE OVER FROMKONRAD ADENAUER NEXT FALL . THEY HAD AN HOUR'S " FRIENDLY /ACTUALLY, THEY TALKED PAST EACH OTHER . DE GAULLE KEPT STRESSING THEMYSTIQUE OF EUROPE, WHILE ERHARD TRIED TO TALK ECONOMICS BUT FOUND THATTHE GENERAL WAS AS LITTLE INTERESTED IN SUCH MATTERS AS THE CHANCELLOR.AS FOR THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY, DE GAULLE MANAGED TO SOUND BOTHHOPEFUL AND CASUAL . " TREATIES, " HE SAID WITH A SHRUG, " ARE LIKEROSES AND YOUNG GIRLS . THEY LAST WHILE THEY LAST . /
