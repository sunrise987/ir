AMEN ! FOR GENERATIONSTHE WHITE WOMEN'S BURDEN IN STEAMY SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS BEEN SHOULDEREDBY AMAHS, THE SOFTFOOTED, TOUGH-FIBERED MAIDSERVANTS WHO WERE RECRUITEDFROM THE CHINESE MAINLAND . WHILE THE AMAH (LITERALLY, " LITTLE MOTHER/ ) COOKED, CLEANED AND LOOKED AFTER THE CHILDREN, THE COLONEL'S LADYOR PLANTER'S WIFE SPENT HER MORNINGS AT TENNIS, HER AFTERNOONS ATBRIDGE, AND APPEARED FRESHLY STARCHED ON THE VERANDA AT SUNDOWN TOGREET HER RETURNING HUSBAND WITH COLD STINGERS, HOT CURRY AND ETERNALCOMPLAINT ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE IN THE TROPICS . IN MALAYA ANDSINGAPORE TODAY, A MEM-SAHIB IS MORE APT TO SPEND HER DAY SCREAMING ATTHE AMAH, DOING THE HOUSEWORK HERSELF, OR ELSE TRYING TO POACH THEPERFECT GEM WHO WORKS FOR THE ARBUTHNOTS . FOR THE OLD-STYLE AMAHS,WHOSE WHITE TUNICS, BLACK SILK PAJAMA TROUSERS AND SMOOTHLY BRAIDEDHAIR MADE THEM LOOK LIKE PIGTAILED PENGUINS, BELONG TO A DYING RACE .SMASHED WEDGWOOD . MOST NEW NATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE ENOUGHTROUBLE ALREADY WITH CHINESE MINORITIES AND ARE DEAD-SET AGAINSTBRINGING IN MORE REFUGEES FROM THE MAINLAND . HASTENING THEIREXTINCTION IS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE FINER AMAHS ARE CANTONESE WOMENWHO TRADITIONALLY BELONG TO KONGSIS, OR SISTERHOODS, THAT PLEDGE THEMTO SPINSTERHOOD . AMAHS FROM HAINAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE USUALLYMARRIED . THEIR HUSBANDS USED TO BE ADMIRABLE CRICHTONS OF COLONIALSOCIETY, AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN TIME USED TO FOLLOW MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPSACROSS THE GLEAMING FLOORS .THOUGH WELL-TRAINED AMAHS NOWADAYS EARN UP TO $70 A MONTH A HIGH WAGEFOR MALAYA THEIR DAUGHTERS MOSTLY PREFER OFFICE AND FACTORY JOBS THATGIVE THEM GREATER FREEDOM WITH NO OVERTONES OF COLONIALISM . THEIRPLACES ARE BEING TAKEN BY A NEW GENERATION OF FLIBBERTIGIBBETS WHOSEMINDS ARE APT TO BE MORE ON MEN THAN HELPING THE " MEM . " MOSTLYMALAYAN OR INDIAN GIRLS, WITH A SPRINKLING OF UNTRAINED CHINESE, THEYARE PRETTIER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THEIR FOREBEARS AND, SAY THEIRMEMS, OFTEN DOWNRIGHT INSOLENT . FOR THEIR PART, THE MAIDS COMPLAINBITTERLY THAT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING MALAYAN MIDDLE CLASS IS EVEN MORETYRANNICAL THAN THE BOSSIEST BRITONS . IF FLEDGLING AMAHS HAVE A TALENTFOR SMASHING THE WEDGWOOD, THE WIVES OF BRITISH SOLDIERS ANDTECHNICIANS, COMING FROM A LAND WHERE SERVANTS HAVE VANISHED FROM ALLBUT THE STATELIEST HOMES, TEND TO BE EVEN CLUMSIER AT HANDLING THE HELP. WAILED ONE SUB-LIEUTENANT'S WIFE WHO RECENTLY HIRED HER FIRST MAID :/ I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TREAT HER AS A SERVANT OR A SISTER . " FRINGEBENEFITS . THE AMAHS' ANSWER IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CIVILSERVANTS . IN MALAYA AN ARMY OF 1,000 AMAHS DONNED SUNDAY-BEST SARONGS,CHEONGSAMS AND SARIS, PILED INTO A FLEET OF BUSSES AND DROVE INTO KUALALUMPUR, THE CAPITAL, WHERE THEY MINCED PRETTILY THROUGH THE WINDINGSTREETS WAVING PLACARDS INSCRIBED : WE WANT JUSTICE AND WE ARE NOTANIMALS . THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH LEFT BLIMPS SNORTING AND OLDSTYLEAMAHS SNEERING, CLIMAXED A COMPLICATED DISPUTE IN WHICH THE AMAHS'UNION IS CHALLENGING A BRITISH WAR OFFICE DECISION TO ABANDON ITSPRACTICE OF HIRING AND FIRING ALL THE AMAHS EMPLOYED BY MILITARYPERSONNEL . SOME 3,000 UNIONIZED AMAHS HAVE ALREADY FORCED THE BRITISHTO BOOST THEIR PAY AND CUT THEIR WORK TIME FROM 70 TO 48 HOURS WEEKLY .BY REMAINING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THEY HOPE ALSO TO WIN FULL CIVILSERVICE STATUS, WITH ITS RICH WELFARE BENEFITS . IN ITS ZEAL, THE UNIONEVEN CABLED LONDON, " RESPECTFULLY " REQUESTING QUEEN ELIZABETH TOINTERVENE IN THE DISPUTE . AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL TALKS WITH THE MILITARYAND BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER SIR GEOFROY TORY, THE AROUSED AMAHS LASTWEEK DIRELY THREATENED A WALKOUT . FOR MANY OF THEIR MEMS, NO HELP ATALL COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN THE HELPLESS HELP THEY HAD .
