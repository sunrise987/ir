GREAT BRITAIN LOTS OF LOOT IN BRITISH MOVIES, CRIME USUALLY PAYSHANDSOMELY AT LEAST IF THE CROOK IS A DEAR OLD CRANK WHOSE ONLY MOTIVEIS TO RAISE SOME LOLLY FOR THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS . IN REALLIFE, LARCENY IS EVEN MORE LUCRATIVE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL WHOSPECIALIZES IN THE SOPHISTICATED JOBS THAT THE ENGLISH CALL "YANKEE-STYLE " CRIME . ROBBERIES ALONE HAVE SOARED BY MORE THAN 200 PERCENT (TO SOME $5,000,000 YEARLY) IN METROPOLITAN LONDON OVER THE PASTDECADE, WHILE PAYROLL THEFTS HAVE GONE UP ALMOST 500 PER CENT SINCE1960 . CHIEF REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN " SNATCHINGS AND RAKINGS, " ASSCOTLAND YARD CALLS THEM, IS THAT THE UNDERWORLD IS NOW MANAGED BYEXECUTIVES WITH A FLAIR FOR ORGANIZATION THAT OUTSTRIPS THE SLEUTHS .THEY ALSO HAVE STYLE . IN THE PAST YEAR ONE GANG HAS MADE FREQUENTHEADLINES BY KNOWLEDGEABLE THEFTS OF PRICELESS SILVER FROM STATELYHOMES, WHOSE DOUGHTY WALLS, IT SEEMS, SCARCELY QUIVER WHEN BURGLARSBLAST OPEN THE PANTRY SAFE . ONE VICTIM, THE MARQUESS OF BRISTOL,LEARNED RECENTLY THAT $56,000 WORTH OF SILVER PINCHED FROM HIS MANSIONLAST FEBRUARY IS NOW IN RUSSIA . ANOTHER UNDERWORLD SPECTACULAR THATFASCINATED BRITONS WAS CARRIED OUT LAST YEAR BY EIGHT DAPPER DASTARDSIN BOWLER HATS, AND DARK SUITS AND CARRYING TIGHTLY FURLED UMBRELLAS,WHO MARCHED INTO LONDON AIRPORT, GRABBED A $175,000 AIRLINE PAYROLL,AND BEAT AN ELEGANT RETREAT IN TWO MATCHING BLUE JAGUARS . LAST WEEKBRITONS COULD TALK OF LITTLE ELSE BUT A COOL LITTLE COUP IN WHICH FOURMEN SWIPED A HALF-TON OF GOLD FROM A FINANCIAL-DISTRICT BULLIONWAREHOUSE IN THE LUNCH HOUR . AFTER TYING UP A WATCHMAN, THE VILLAINSNONCHALANTLY LUGGED FORTY 27-LB . GOLD BARS WORTH $560,000 ACROSS ASIDEWALK INTO A BLUE DELIVERY VAN, THEN MADE A CLEAN GETAWAY DESPITE ATRAFFIC-STOPPING DASH THE WRONG WAY ON A ONE-WAY STREET . HOPING TOKEEP THE CULPRITS FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY, SCOTLAND YARD POSTED MEN ATEVERY AIRFIELD AND SEAPORT IN BRITAIN . FLYING-SQUAD OFFICERS CHECKEDEVERY SMALL FOUNDRY IN LONDON ON THE OFF-CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT NAB THEGANG IN THE ACT OF MELTING THEIR HAUL INTO EASILY PORTABLE NUGGETS . ATWEEK'S END THE NEW LAVENDER HILL MOB, AS FLEET STREET INEVITABLYCHRISTENED IT, WAS STILL AT LARGE PROBABLY, GUESSED SCOTLAND YARD,HOLED UP WITHIN METROPOLITAN LONDON . UNLIKE ALEC GUINNESS' MOB, WHICHMELTED DOWN ITS LOOT INTO SOLD-GOLD EIFFEL TOWER SOUVENIRS AND SHIPPEDTHEM TO PARIS, THE REAL-LIFE QUARTET PROBABLY AIMED TO EXPORT ITSBULLION TO INDIA, WHERE GOLD FETCHES TWICE THE WORLD MARKET PRICE .
