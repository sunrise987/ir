A DASHING DANE WITH A NOSE FOR OPPORTUNITYAND AN EYE FOR PRETTY WOMEN, HE HAS BEEN MARRIED TWICE : FIRST TOSWEDISH ACTRESS BIRGIT TENGROTH, CURRENTLY TO DANISH MOVIE STAR HELLEVIRKNER, WHO HAS BEEN NAMED AS ONE OF EUROPE'S TEN MOST ATTRACTIVEWOMEN . IN COPENHAGEN LAST WEEK, AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE, KRAGFACED HIS SUPREME POLITICAL TEST WHEN HE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT ACOMPLEX SERIES OF MEASURES THAT WILL 1) EXTEND ALL UNION CONTRACTS FORTWO YEARS, THUS LIMITING WAGE INCREASES ; 2) FIX MAXIMUM PRICES OF ALLCONSUMER GOODS EXCEPT FISH AND FARM PRODUCTS ; AND 3) COMPEL ALLTAXPAYERS TO BUY UP TO $290 IN 4 PER CENT BONDS THAT CANNOT BE REDEEMEDFOR FIVE YEARS . A TRAINED ECONOMIST, KRAG INSISTED THAT HIS DRACONIANMEASURES ARE ESSENTIAL ; MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION IN EUROPE, DENMARKHAD STAKED ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE ON JOINING THE COMMON MARKET ALONG WITHBRITAIN . WHEN DE GAULLE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP, FRANCE'SPRESIDENT SHREWDLY PROMISED DENMARK IMMEDIATE ADMISSION . KRAG'S REPLYWAS SHARP AND TO THE POINT : " WE HAVE NO WISH TO BE ONE OF PRESIDENTDE GAULLE'S PIECES IN THE POLITICAL CHESS GAME WITH BRITAIN . IT ISIMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR TWO MAJOR CUSTOMERS, BRITAIN AND WESTGERMANY, INSIDE THE SAME ORGANIZATION . IT MUST BE OUR PURPOSE IN ALLFIELDS TO SEE THAT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A UNIFIED EUROPE GO ON . " BUTKRAG'S LOYALTY TO HIS FRIENDS ABROAD HARDLY ALLAYED HIS HEADACHES ATHOME . RACKED BY SEVERE INFLATION, DENMARK LAST YEAR SAW ITS TRADEDEFICIT DANGEROUSLY INCREASED TO $486 MILLION, WHILE ITS CURRENCYRESERVES WERE CUT IN HALF . IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, DANISH WAGES HAVERISEN 40 PER CENT , PRODUCTION LESS THAN 20 PER CENT . THE STRINGENTNEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM DREW ANGUISHED CRIES FROM EMPLOYERS AND THEPOLITICAL OPPOSITION, BUT KRAG CURTLY REJECTED THE TRADITIONAL DANISHCOMPROMISE . KRAG'S COALITION GOVERNMENT CAN UNDOUBTEDLY SQUEEZE THEBILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT BY ITS USUAL ONE-VOTE MAJORITY, AND THE DANESWILL HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS FOR YEARS OF AUSTERITY AHEAD .
