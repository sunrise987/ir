GREAT BRITAIN THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE WHAT THE HELL ISGOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY ? SHOUTED THE DAILY MIRROR . AS IF ANYONEDIDN'T KNOW . WHAT WENT ON WAS JUST THE KIND OF STORY ON WHICH THEMIRROR THRIVES . ALTHOUGH IT HAD STARTED OUTMERELY AS VENERY IN HIGH (ANDSEVERAL LOW) PLACES, IT GREW INTO A MAJOR SCANDAL THAT NOT ONLY SMASHEDTHE CAREER OF A PROMISING TORY POLITICIAN, BUT ALSO RAISED SOMETROUBLING QUESTIONS ABOUT BRITISH SECURITY AND ROCKED THE MACMILLANGOVERNMENT . OTHERWISE, IT READ LIKE LA DOLCE VITA, ANGLO-SAXON STYLE .THE STORY FIRST EMERGED PARTIALLY LAST MARCH, WHEN ITS LEADINGCHARACTERS BECAME PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED : RED-HAIRED CHRISTINE KEELER,WHO CAME FROM MIDDLESEX TO SLING HASH AT 17, AND AT 21 WAS THE WESTEND'S MOST-CALLED GIRL ; JOHN PROFUMO, 48, THE ABLE WAR MINISTER ANDMAN-ABOUT-MAYFAIR, WHOSE VIRILE CHARM PROVED SOMETHING OF A TORY ASSETAFTER THOSE HOMOSEXUAL SPY SCANDALS ,; AND DR . STEPHEN WARD, 43, ASOCIAL OSTEOPATH (AND SON OF THE ANGLICAN CANON OF ROCHESTERCATHEDRAL), WHO SAID HE LIKED HELPING ATTRACTIVE GIRLS OF HUMBLE BIRTHADAPT TO " THE NEEDS AND STRESSES OF MODERN LIVING . " AFTER MONTHS OFRUMOR, A LABOR M.P . CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT TO DENY THE RUMORS OF AMINISTER'S INDISCRETIONS WITH CHRISTINE . PROFUMO'S FIRM DENIAL OFWRONGDOING, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT FROM PRIME MINISTERMACMILLAN, QUASHED THE STORY TEMPORARILY UNTIL IT BURST FORTH AGAINLAST WEEK . THIS TIME PROFUMO RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER ANABRUPT, ABJECT CONFESSION THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIED TO THE PRIMEMINISTER, HIS COLLEAGUES AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS . COEXISTENCE . OFNOBLE ITALIAN DESCENT, JOHN DENNIS PROFUMO HAD EVERY QUALIFICATION TOREACH THE TORIES' TOP RANKS : HARROW AND OXFORD, FINE WAR RECORD,BRAINS, DRIVE, AND A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, MOVIE ACTRESS VALERIE (GREATEXPECTATIONS) HOBSON . TOGETHER, THE PROFUMOS WERE WEEKENDING ATCLIVEDEN, FAMED COUNTRY ESTATE OF LORD AND LADY ASTOR, WHEN THEY WEREINTRODUCED TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 . ALSO PRESENT : STEPHEN WARD, WHO HADA COTTAGE ON THE PLACE . THEREAFTER, VALERIE STAYED HOME WHILE JACKVISITED CHRISTINE AT WARD'S FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . WHAT THE WARMINISTER NEVER KNEW WAS THAT CHRISTINE HAD ANOTHER REGULAR VISITOR,EVGENY IVANOV, WHO WAS A SOVIET NAVAL ATTACHE IN LONDON . A ROUND-EYEDOBSERVER OF THEIR COEXISTENCE WAS NYMPHET MARILYN ( " MANDY " )RICE-DAVIES, A WELL-DEVELOPED 16-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS ONE OF CHRISTINE'SINTIMATES . " THE FARCICAL THING ABOUT IT ALL, " AS MANDY TOLD THEPRESS, " WAS THAT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AS JACK LEFT CHRISTINE ATTHE FLAT, IVANOV WALKED IN . " IT POSSIBLY SEEMED LESS HILARIOUS TOBRITISH MI-5 INTELLIGENCE AGENTS, WHO WERE SHADOWING IVANOV AT THETIME, TO FIND THAT THEIR WAR MINISTER WAS UNWITTINGLY SHARING A BEDWITH A SUSPECTED SOVIET SPY .THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE THOUGH THEY TRIED NOT TO BE SEEN INPUBLIC, PROFUMO SOMETIMES TOOK CHRISTINE FOR DRIVES, SHE LATER RECALLED. " HE SHOWED ME THE WAR OFFICE, WHERE HE WORKED . HE EVEN SHOWED MEDOWNING STREET . " BUT IN TIME PROFUMO STOPPED SEEING CHRISTINEBECAUSE, SHE EXPLAINED, HE WAS " SCARED IT WOULD RUIN HIS CAREER . "COMRADE IVANOV WAS SHIPPED OFF TO MOSCOW, AND THE " MODEL " FROMMIDDLESEX, WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR JAZZ ON THE WAY UP, HIT THEBLUES BELT AND ACQUIRED A JAMAICAN LOVER NAMED JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE . BUTHE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HER TELEPHONE WAS FOR . " HE SEEMED TOTHINK, " CHRISTINE COMPLAINED LATER, " THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE WITHHIM FOREVER . " ONE DAY, JOHNNIE SHOWED UP WITH A GUN AND FIRED SEVERALBULLETS INTO THE DOOR BEFORE THE BOBBIES BAGGED HIM . MULTIRACIALISM .AFTER JOHNNIE WENT TO JAIL, THERE WAS ANOTHER WEST INDIAN LOVER,ALOYSIUS " LUCKY " GORDON, WHO, IF ANYTHING, WAS EVEN MORE NARROWMINDED. IN APRIL HE BEAT HER UP . LAST WEEK, AT HIS TRIAL FOR ASSAULT,ALOYSIUS WAS SO UNGALLANT AS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAD KEPT HER SUPPLIEDWITH MARIJUANA, WHILE ALL SHE GAVE HIM IN RETURN WAS VD . " YOU CAN SAYTHIS FOR CHRISTINE, " SAID A LEADING LABOR POLITICIAN . " AT LEASTSHE'S MULTIRACIAL . " THE SCANDAL MIGHT HAVE DIED, HAD IT NOT BEENRESURRECTED BY STEPHEN WARD HIMSELF . SEVEN WEEKS AFTER PROFUMO'SDENIAL, HE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THAT THE WARMINISTER HAD LIED IN COMMONS, THAT HE HAD INDEED HAD AN AFFAIR WITHCHRISTINE KEELER . WARD REPEATED HIS CHARGES IN LETTERS TO HOMESECRETARY HENRY BROOKE AND LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON . PROFUMOWAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW ACCUSATION, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEKTHAT HE STARTLED TORY OFFICIALS BY BLURTING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTINEIN A LETTER TO THE VACATIONING PRIME MINISTER, PROFUMO RESIGNED ASWAR MINISTER AND AS M.P . FOR STRATFORD-ON-AVON, CONFESSING HIS " GRAVEMISDEMEANOR . " SAID HE : " I CANNOT TELL YOU OF MY DEEP REMORSE . "MACMILLAN ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION, DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR AS " A GREATTRAGEDY . " THEN PROFUMO AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR REGENT'S PARK HOME ANDDISAPPEARED INTO THE COUNTRY . DILEMMA . THE SCANDAL HE LEFT BEHIND GOTLIVELIER EVERY DAY . CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO WAS BACK FROM A CONTINENTALHOLIDAY AND SUDDENLY SPORTED A " BUSINESS MANAGER " AND A NEWROLLS-ROYCE, ADDED MORE OFF-COLOR TO THE SAGA BY TELLING AND SELLINGHER STORY TO THE PAPERS . " I WAS VERY FOND OF JACK, " SHE SAIDWISTFULLY . " IF EVER WE MEET AGAIN, WE HAVE AT LEAST THIS IN COMMONBOTH OUR CAREERS HAVE BEEN RUINED . " MANDY CHIMED IN WITH DETAILS OFTHE HIGH LIVING THAT HAD EARNED HER A JAGUAR, MINK AND DIAMONDS BY HER17TH BIRTHDAY . AT ONE DINNER PARTY, SHE RECALLED, " A NAKED MANWEARING A MASK WAITED ON TABLE LIKE A SLAVE . HE HAD TO HAVE A MASKBECAUSE HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN . /MEANWHILE STEPHEN WARD'S EXPLANATIONS FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS AND TVSCREENS . THE AFFAIR, HE PROTESTED, HAD GIVEN RISE TO " A WHOLE TRAINOF RUMORS, AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED, WITH THE IMPLICATIONTHAT I'D BEEN TRYING TO PROCURE THEM FOR MISS KEELER . " DESPITE HISSUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PROFUMO AND THE GOVERNMENT, SAID WARD, HEHAD REPORTED PROFUMO'S LIAISON TO BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT WAS ATITS HEIGHT IN 1961 . SAID HE : " I'VE ALMOST HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN .IT'S A TERRIBLE DILEMMA . ONE DIDN'T WANT TO BITCH UP ANYBODY . YOU OWEIT TO YOUR FRIENDS . BUT I MUST CLEAR MYSELF . " FOR THE IMMEDIATEFUTURE, STEPHEN WARD WILL DO HIS EXPLAINING IN COURT . AT WEEK'S ENDSCOTLAND YARD PLUCKED THE OSTEOPATH FROM HIS WHITE JAGUAR SPORTS CARAND JAILED HIM ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING BRITAIN'S SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT BY/ LIVING WHOLLY OR IN PART ON THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . " UNREST .AS A MATTER OF POLITICAL TACTICS, THE LABOR PARTY DECIDED TO TREAT THEPROFUMO AFFAIR NOT SO MUCH AS A MORAL INDICTMENT OF UPPERCRUST BRITAINBUT RATHER AS ANOTHER FLAGRANT EXAMPLE OF THE ERRATIC WORKINGS OFBRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM . IF, ARGUED LABORITES, BRITISH INTELLIGENCEHAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT BRITAIN'S WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED A CALL GIRLWITH A SOVIET AGENT, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE TO BREAK UP A LIAISON THATMIGHT EXPOSE HIM TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL ? WAS MACMILLAN TOLD ? IF SO,HAD THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED PROFUMO TO LIE ABOUT HIS DALLIANCE WITHCHRISTINE KEELER SOLELY IN ORDER TO AVERT A DAMAGING SCANDAL ?UNFLAPPABLE HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO DID NOT ALLOW LAST WEEK'S EVENTS TOINTERRUPT HIS GOLFING VACATION, WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEGOVERNMENT'S CASE WHEN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXT WEEK . HE MAY YET, ASIN THE PAST, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS IN COMMONS . BUT THE AFFAIR MAYSERIOUSLY AFFECT THE TORIES' ALREADY SHAKY CHANCES AT THE NEXTELECTIONS, WHICH MACMILLAN WILL NOW PROBABLY TRY TO DELAY . SAID TORYBACKBENCHER LORD LAMBTON : " THE HARM THIS WILL DO TO THE CONSERVATIVEPARTY WILL BE ENORMOUS . THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME A GENERAL FEELINGOF UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO THE MORALITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT. THIS FEELING WILL BE IMMENSELY INCREASED . /
