TURKEY JUST ANY GOVERNMENT AT ALL TURKEY SEEMS TO BE IN THE GRIPOF A PERPETUAL CRISIS . AFTER THE ARMY TOPPLED THE CORRUPT,FREE-SPENDING REGIME OF PREMIER ADNAN MENDERES IN 1960 AND EXECUTEDHIM, THE MILITARY RULED INEFFECTUALLY FOR 18 MONTHS, THEN LET CIVILIANSTAKE OVER . DURABLE ISMET INONU BECAME PREMIER, DECIDED TO TRY TO HOLDTHE COUNTRY TOGETHER AMIDST THE LINGERING BITTERNESS WITHOUT CURBINGPARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY . PROBABLY NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DONE IT .INONU, 80, SEEMED LIKE AN EMBODIMENT OF TURKEY'S PAST : BORN UNDER THESULTANATE, HE WAS ONE OF KEMAL ATATURK'S MOST DASHING REVOLUTIONARYGENERALS, FIRST BECAME PRIME MINISTER IN 1923, SERVED ON AND OFF ASPREMIER OR PRESIDENT OF TURKEY FOR 40 YEARS . YET LAST WEEK INONU WASAGAIN FIGHTING TO SAVE TURKEY FROM NEW POLITICAL TURMOIL . NEW DILEMMA. INONU AND HIS PEOPLE'S REPUBLICAN PARTY INAUGURATED OVERDUE REFORMS,BUT THESE DID NOT NECESSARILY MAKE HIM POPULAR . BUREAUCRATS WEREANGERED BY HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST WASTE . BUSINESSMEN AND BIG LANDOWNERSWERE INCENSED BY NEW SCHEMES TO MAKE THEM PAY TAXES . PLAIN CONSUMERSWERE MAD AT THE ATTEMPT TO PUT GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES ON A PROFITMAKINGBASIS, WHICH RAISED PRICES . PEASANTS, WHO STILL WOULD RATHER HAVE NEWMOSQUES THAN NEW SCHOOLS, HANKERED FOR THE OLD DAYS WHEN MENDERES BUILT8,000 VILLAGE SHRINES . MENDERES' HEIRS IN THE JUSTICE PARTY KEPTGAINING GROUND WITH THEIR STRANGE MIXTURE OF AGING LEADERS FOREVERTROTTING OUT THE GHOST OF THE DEAD LEADER AND YOUNG POLITICIANS FOREVERPROMISING THAT THEY COULD RUN THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN INONU . INLAST MONTH'S NATIONWIDE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, INONU WAS PLAINLYOVERCONFIDENT . WHILE JUSTICE PARTY LEADER RAGIP GUMUSPALA, 66,CAMPAIGNED STRENUOUSLY, COVERING THOUSANDS OF MILES A WEEK, INONULOFTILY LIMITED HIS POLITICKING TO A SINGLE 20-MINUTE RADIO SPEECH .THE RESULTS GAVE INONU'S REPUBLICANS ONLY 37 PER CENT OF THE VOTE ;TWO SMALLER PARTIES IN INONU'S SHAKY GOVERNMENT COALITION WEREVIRTUALLY WIPED OUT . THE WINNER WAS THE JUSTICE PARTY, WITH 46 PERCENT OF THE BALLOTS . LAST WEEK INONU RESIGNED . HIS DILEMMA : NEITHERMAJOR PARTY CAN RULE SEPARATELY, SINCE EACH LACKS A PARLIAMENTARYMAJORITY, AND NEITHER WANTS TO RULE JOINTLY, SINCE THAT EXPERIMENT WASTRIED ONCE BEFORE, LASTED SEVEN MONTHS AND ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING . NONEOF THE SMALLER PARTIES SEEM EAGER TO JOIN ANOTHER COALITION, EITHER .NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS ? NOBODY IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THAT IDEA . TRYAGAIN . FOR THE TIME BEING, AT LEAST, THE ARMY WAS STICKING TO ITSPLEDGE OF POLITICAL NEUTRALITY, BUT NO ONE COULD BE SURE HOW LONG THEMILITARY WOULD RESIST THE IDEA OF RESTORING " STABILITY " BY STAGINGANOTHER TAKEOVER . BY WEEK'S END TURKEY'S PRESIDENT, GENERAL CEMALGURSEL, CAME TO INONU AND ASKED HIM TO FORM A NEW CABINET ;CONCEIVABLY, HE MIGHT SUCCEED, BY PERSUADING ONE OF THE SMALL PARTIESTO JOIN A COALITION AND PICKING UP ENOUGH DEFECTORS ELSEWHERE TO SCRAPEUP A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY . AFTER ALL, INONU'S IMMEDIATE AIM WAS NOTA STABLE GOVERNMENT, BUT ANY GOVERNMENT AT ALL .
