ON THE OTHER HAND NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S SPEECH STARTED OFF LIKE JUSTONE MORE OF HIS EXHAUSTIVE EXHORTATIONS FOR HARDER WORK BY PARTY BOSSESAND FACTORY HANDS . BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS THROUGH, THREE HOURS LATER,HIS RAMBLING REMARKS IN THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES HADTOUCHED OFF A FRESH TORRENT OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE FUTURE LEADERSHIPOF THE SOVIET UNION . AND ALL BECAUSE OF A FEW VAGUE SENTENCES ABOUTOLD AGE . MUSED THE KREMLIN COMMISSAR : " HERE AM I, A MAN OF THEOLDER GENERATION . . . I AM ALREADY 69, AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT I CANNOTHOLD FOREVER THE POSITIONS I NOW HOLD IN THE PARTY AND THE STATE . "CRYSTAL BALLS . WHAT ON EARTH DID KHRUSHCHEV MEAN ? WAS HE ABOUT TORESIGN AS PREMIER OF THE NATION, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNISTPARTY, OR BOTH ? HAD HE LOST OUT IN A BACK-ROOM POWER STRUGGLE ? ORWAS HE MERELY TRYING TO SMOOTH THE WAY FOR A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR ? IFTHE PUBLIC WAS BAFFLED, SO WERE THE FREE WORLD'S KREMLINOLOGISTS, THATTIGHT LITTLE BAND OF EXPERTS WHO SPEND HALF THEIR TIME READING BETWEENPRAVDA'S LINES AND HALF PEERING INTO THEIR CRYSTAL BALLS . FOR WEEKS,THE EXPERTS HAD BEEN FERVERISHLY SPECULATING OVER KHRUSHCHEV'S POSSIBLEHEIR . THE FAVORITE WAS HANDSOME, HARD-BOILED FROL KOZLOV, 54, NO . 2MAN IN THE PARTY, WHOM NIKITA HAD QUIETLY SINGLED OUT AS HIS CHOICEALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO (TIME COVER, JULY 13, 1959) . BUT OTHER EXPERTSEXCITEDLY POINTED OUT THAT KOZLOV WAS THE ONLY KREMLIN LEADER ABSENTFROM A MAJOR MOSCOW BLOWOUT LAST WEEK MARKING THE 93RD ANNIVERSARY OFLENIN'S BIRTH, THUS CONCLUDED THAT KOZLOV MIGHT BE ON THE SKIDS . ONTHE BASIS OF SUCH BARELY VISIBLE CLUES, WEARY KREMLINOLOGISTS STAKETHEIR REPUTATIONS . ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BUNCH, BRITAIN'S EDWARDCRANKSHAW, INSPIRED ONE THEORY OF NIKITA'S FUTURE WITH A FRONTPAGESTORY IN LONDON'S OBSERVER DECLARING THAT AGING KHRUSHCHEV MIGHTANNOUNCE HIS RETIREMENT " WITHIN TWO YEARS " AT THE COMING MAY 28MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE . WHO TOLD HIM ? "WELL-INFORMED SOVIET SOURCES, " OF COURSE . ALL GUESSWORK . IT IS NOTEASY TO SAY WHO SHOULD BE BELIEVED . FROM JEREMY WOLFENDEN, LONDONDAILY TELEGRAPH CORRESPONDENT IN MOSCOW, CAME WORD THAT " RUSSIANSOURCES DECISIVELY REJECT THE IDEA THAT MR . KHRUSHCHEV WILL RETIREEITHER FROM THE PREMIERSHIP OR THE SECRETARYSHIP OF THE PARTY . " MERLEFAINSOD, DIRECTOR OF HARVARD'S RUSSIAN RESEARCH CENTER, SAID CRANKSHAW/ IS SPINNING THINGS OUT RATHER THIN . " WILLIAM GRIFFITH, RESEARCHASSOCIATE ON COMMUNIST AFFAIRS AT M.I.T.'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONALSTUDIES, DECLARED, " I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE IS ONCRANKSHAW'S SIDE . " BUT JUST IN CASE IT WAS, GRIFFITH ADDED : " YOUCAN ARGUE EITHER WAY ; EITHER KHRUSHCHEV IS IN TROUBLE, OR HE'S SOSECURE IN POWER THAT HE CAN PERFECTLY WELL AFFORD TO MENTION RETIRING ./ ONE DARING DEMONOLOGIST EVEN SUGGESTED THAT NIKITA HIMSELF GAILY WASSPREADING THE RUMORS IN ORDER TO RALLY MORE SUPPORT . ON THE OTHERHAND, WOLFGANG LEONHARD, THE EX-COMMUNIST WHO NOW ANALYZES RED AFFAIRSFOR WEST GERMANY'S DIE ZEIT, THOUGHT IT WAS " VERY POSSIBLE THATKHRUSHCHEV WILL GIVE UP ONE OF HIS POSTS, MORE LIKELY THE GOVERNMENTJOB . " THE FREE-FOR-ALL WAS CLEARLY GETTING OUT OF HAND ; SOMEWHATUNPROFESSIONALLY THE GUARDIAN'S POLISH-BORN SOVIET EXPERT, VICTORZORZA, SHRUGGED, " IT'S ALL GUESSWORK, " THEN PLUNGED BACK INTO THEFRAY .
