TUNISIA DOUBLE JEOPARDY AS A DEDICATED TUNISIAN NATIONALIST,PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, IS A POPULAR HERO TO MOST OF THEMILLIONS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED HIM SINCE INDEPENDENCE WAS WON IN 1956 . BUTBOURGUIBA ALSO HAS HIS DEADLY ENEMIES . LAST WEEK A DETERMINED GROUP OFTHE LATTER ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN ASSASSINATING TUNISIA'S STOCKYCHIEFTAIN . THE PLOTTERS ACTUALLY MADE TWO ATTEMPTS ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE. THE FIRST TRY FAILED ON DEC . 15 BECAUSE BOURGUIBA DID NOT SPEND THENIGHT AT HIS PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT CARTHAGE, NEAR TUNIS . THE PLOTTERSNEXT LAID THEIR PLANS FOR MIDNIGHT, DEC . 21, AND EVEN BOURGUIBA'SPERSONAL BODYGUARD AGREED TO LEAD THE KILLERS TO THE PRESIDENT'SBEDSIDE . NO REPLACEMENT . A FEW HOURS BEFORE MIDNIGHT, A TUNISIAN ARMYNON-COM BURST IN UPON A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND BLURTED THEDETAILS OF THE PLOT . THAT NIGHT, AND ON FOLLOWING DAYS, MORE THAN AHUNDRED PLOTTERS WERE JAILED . THEY PROVED TO BE A HANDFUL OF DISSIDENTARMY OFFICERS AND SOME DISGRUNTLED LANDOWNERS . BUT THE HARD CORESEEMED TO BE SUPPORTERS OF BOURGUIBA'S OLD FOE, THE LATE SALAH BENYOUSSEF, WHO LOST A BITTER STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF NEO-DESTOUR,TUNISIA'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY, AND WENT INTO EXILE IN 1955 . WHEN BENYOUSSEF WAS MURDERED IN WEST GERMANY IN 1961 HIS FOLLOWERS BACK HOMEBLAMED BOURGUIBA AGENTS, SWORE VENGEANCE ON TUNISIA'S BOSS HIMSELF .THE PLOTTERS' ONLY PLAN, APPARENTLY, WAS TO SLAY THE PRESIDENT . SAIDBOURGUIBA : " AFTER MY DEATH THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OFTOTAL ANARCHY . THE PLOTTERS THOUGHT ONLY OF ELIMINATING ME, NOTREPLACING ME . " CROWDS GATHERED TO HEAR OFFICIAL SPEECHES OFINDIGNATION AT THE ATTEMPT ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE . THERE SEEMED LITTLEDOUBT THAT HE STILL HELD THE NATION'S BASIC LOYALTY, BUT EVEN HISCLOSEST FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED AT THE RECENT SIGNS OF UNREST CAUSED BYTHREE SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND AN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL OF 400,000OUT OF A POPULATIONS OF 4,000,000 . BOURGUIBA IS ALSO AWARE OF THEMUTTERING OF MANY ABOUT THE THREE EXPENSIVE NEW PALACES HE HAS RECENTLYBUILT . THESE " BELONG TO THE STATE, " HE RETORTED IN HIS " I AM ALIVE/ SPEECH . HE ADDED WITH SOME BITTERNESS : " THERE IS A TENDENCY TOFORGET THAT I SPENT 30 YEARS IN FRENCH JAILS FOR MY COUNTRY . " KNOCKEDHEADS . IN HIS EFFORTS TO RESHAPE TUNISIA AS A MODERN NATION, BOURGUIBAHAS HAD TO KNOCK HEADS TOGETHER . INEVITABLY, SOME ARMY OFFICERS RESENTTHE BACKSEAT ROLE HE GIVES THE MILITARY . AND MOSLEM RELIGIOUS LEADERSARE ANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH THE DAY-LONG FASTS OF THE MONTHOF RAMADAN, AND BY HIS EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN . A U.S .INVESTIGATINGCOMMITTEE IN 1961 AGREED THAT BOURGUIBA WAS MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES TOSOLVE TUNIS'S ECONOMIC ILLS, BUT WARNED THAT HE MIGHT BE ASKING TOOGREAT SACRIFICES OF HIS PEOPLE . AFTER LAST WEEK'S BRUSH WITH DEATH,BOURGUIBA MAY GO FORWARD A BIT MORE SLOWLY, AND CAN UNDOUBTEDLY DRAWSOME SUPPORT FROM THE FACT THAT LAST MONTH THE U.S . FINALLY AGREED TOGRANT TUNISIA $180 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS .
