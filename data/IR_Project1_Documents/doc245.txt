MOROCCO A KING'S HEADACHE HIGH IN A SNOW-SWATHED CEDAR GROVE INTHE ATLAS MOUNTAINS, THE YOUNG KING OF MOROCCO STOOD CASTING ALONE FORTROUT IN AN ICY STREAM . HASSAN II ENJOYED GOOD LUCK, WHICH WAS NOTSURPRISING SINCE NO ONE ELSE WAS ALLOWED TO FISH THE WELL-STOCKEDRESERVE AT THE ROYAL RESORT OF IFRANE . NOR WERE THERE ANY MESSY CHORES. NO SOONER WOULD THE KING HOOK ANOTHER PRIZE THAN FIVE SERVANTS RUSHEDTO REMOVE THE WRIGGLING CATCH FROM THE ROYAL LINE . BUT FOR ALL THEOUTWARD CALM THAT MARKED HIS VACATION LAST WEEK, MOROCCO'S 33-YEAR-OLDMONARCH HAD PROBLEMS ON HIS MIND . THEY HAD TO DO WITH THE OUTCOMETHREE WEEKS AGO OF THE NATION'S FIRST LEGISLATIVE ELECTION IN SEVENYEARS OF INDEPENDENCE . HASSAN HAD BEEN PROUD TO TAKE THIS CAUTIOUSSTEP TOWARD DEMOCRACY, BUT HE HAD ALSO BEEN CONFIDENT THAT HIS OWNROYAL PARTY, THE F.D.C.I., WOULD WIN AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF SEATSOF THE 144-MEMBER HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES . THINGS DID NOT WORK OUT ASPLANNED . SEMIOFFICIAL RESULTS LAST WEEK CONFIRMED THAT HASSAN'S PARTYHAD WON ONLY 69 SEATS, FOUR SHORT OF A MAJORITY . MOREOVER, SEVEN OFNINE CABINET MINISTERS RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE UNDER THE KING'S BANNERLOST THEIR RACES, AND THE TWO OPPOSITION PARTIES, THE NATIONALISTISTIQLAL AND THE LEFT-LEANING NATIONAL UNION OF POPULAR FORCES, SHOWEDSTARTLING STRENGTH, WINNING 43 AND 28 SEATS RESPECTIVELY . IF THEYGANGED UP IN A COALITION, THE TWO GROUPS MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEHOUSE . STEAMED UP BY THEIR NEW PRESTIGE, OPPOSITION LEADERS WEREALREADY DEMANDING THAT THE KING'S PRESENT RUBBER-STAMP CABINET BEDISSOLVED AND BOLDLY ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF FRAUD AT THE POLLS .ISTIQLAL POLITICIANS EVEN WENT AROUND TO THE U.S . EMBASSY COMPLAININGTHAT F.D.C.I . HAD BOUGHT VOTES WITH U.S . GIFT WHEAT . HASSAN HAD SOMEALTERNATIVES, NONE OF THEM VERY PLEASANT : HE COULD MAKE HIS OWNCOALITION WITH ONE OF THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, A SOLUTION DIFFICULT TOACHIEVE WITHOUT LOSING ROYAL FACE . OR HE COULD DECLARE A " RECOUNT "OF VOTES AND RIG THE RESULTS, A COURSE REPUGNANT TO THE IDEALISTICMONARCH . USING THE CONSTITUTION HE DRAFTED LAST YEAR, HASSAN COULDEVEN DISSOLVE THE HOUSE AND FORGET ABOUT THE DEMOCRACY HE HAD PROMISEDTHE NATION . WRESTLING WITH HIS DILEMMA, THE KING GOT LITTLE SYMPATHYFROM THE OPPOSITION . JEERED NATIONAL UNION LEADER ABDERRAKIM BENABID: " IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY AT DEMOCRAT AND DICTATOR AT THE SAME TIME
