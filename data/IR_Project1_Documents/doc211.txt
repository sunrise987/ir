SOUTH VIET NAM THE PINPRICK WAR LUMBERING LOW OVER STONEAGE VILLAGES AND THICK JUNGLES, TROOP-CARRYING HELICOPTERS SWARMEDACROSS THE WILD CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF VIET NAM LAST WEEK . ON THEGROUND, 10,000 SOUTH VIETNAMESE INFANTRYMEN AND MARINES SPREAD OUT OVERA VAST, INHOSPITABLE SECTOR SOUTH OF TAMKY WHERE NO GOVERNMENT TROOPSHAD SET FOOT SINCE 1938 . IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVES AGAINST THECOMMUNIST VIET CONG SINCE THE GUERRILLA WAR BROKE OUT IN 1959, SOUTHVIET NAM'S GOVERNMENT HOPED TO FLUSH SIX RED BATTALIONS AND AHEADQUARTERS COMPANY FROM ITS LONGTIME STRONGHOLD IN THE MOUNTAINS .MAIN OBJECT OF THE MONTH-LONG OPERATION WAS TO DESTROY VIET CONG FOODCACHES AND CUT THE REDS' MAIN SUPPLY LINE, THE 400-MILE HO CHI MINHTRAIL TO NORTH VIET NAM THROUGH NEUTRAL LAOS . THE REDS HAD PLAINLYEVACUATED THE AREA IN ADVANCE, BUT VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS EXPLAINED THATTHEY DID NOT AIM TO KILL VIET CONG GUERRILLAS, ONLY TO ISOLATE THEM .IF SUCCESSFUL, SAID ONE, THE SWEEP " WILL SOLVE 50 PER CENT OF OURMILITARY PROBLEMS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS . " NOT SO, RETORTED SOME OFTHE U.S . OFFICERS WHO WERE TAKING PART . " IT WOULD TAKE A WHOLE U.S .ARMY DIVISION TO BLOCK THAT TRAIL, " SAID ONE . THE CLASH OF OPINIONEXTENDS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF THE FRUSTRATING, WEARISOME WAR INSOUTH VIET NAM AND REFLECTS ITS SHADOWY, HIDE-AND-SEEK NATURE . IT IS AWAR WITH NO FRONT LINES AND NO DECISIVE BATTLES ; A WAR OFCONTAINMENT, NOT OF CONQUEST ; A WAR OF LILLIPUTIAN PINPRICKS ANDBROBDINGNAGIAN STAKES . IT IS A DAY WAR AND A NIGHT WAR, IN WHICH THEGOVERNMENT CONTROLS MOST HIGHWAYS AND WATERWAYS BY DAYLIGHT (THOUGH AU.S . LIEUTENANT AND TWO VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN A DAYLIGHTROADSIDE AMBUSH LAST WEEK), AND THE VIET CONG SLIP IN FROM JUNGLES ANDSWAMPS TO TAKE CHARGE AFTER DARK . IN THE RUGGED NORTH, IT IS AMOUNTAIN WAR, IN WHICH THE REDS ARE SHORT OF FOOD, MEDICINE, WEAPONS,AND LARGELY ON THE DEFENSIVE ; IN THE SOUTH, IT IS A BATTLE FOR THENATION'S RICE GRANARY, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE CUNNINGLY FOILED EVERYGOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THEM OUT . TURNING THE CORNER . HOW IS THEWAR ACTUALLY GOING ? MEASURED AGAINST THE DESPERATE SITUATION THATFACED GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR ON A FACT-FINDING MISSION FOR THEPRESIDENT 19 MONTHS AGO, THERE IS ROOM FOR QUALIFIED OPTIMISM . WHENSECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT MCNAMARA RETURNED FROM A CONFERENCE WITHSERVICE CHIEFS IN PEARL HARBOR LAST WEEK, THE PENTAGON SAID " THECORNER HAS DEFINITELY BEEN TURNED TOWARD VICTORY . " NO ONE WAS SETTINGANY TIMETABLE, BUT U.S . MILITARY CHIEFS AND SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENTNGO DINH DIEM SAY THAT THE WAR SHOULD BE WON " WITHIN THREE YEARS . "THERE ARE MANY SOLDIERS IN SOUTH VIET NAM WHO CONSIDER THIS WILDLYOPTIMISTIC ; SOME BELIEVE THAT THE WAR MAY NEVER BE WON . BUT ALMOSTEVERYONE AGREES THAT THINGS HAVE IMPROVED . TODAY THERE IS LITTLEDANGER THAT THE VIET CONG WILL TAKE OVER ANY OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S CITIES. CAPTURED RED DOCUMENTS INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE OF ASWIFT CONQUEST, NOW AIM MERELY, AS THE GUERRILLAS' NORTH VIETNAMESEBOSS HO CHI MINH SAID RECENTLY, " TO WAIT OUT THE AMERICANS . " THESOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT AND ITS 14,000 U.S . MILITARY " ADVISERS "PIN THEIR HOPES ON AN INTEGRATED, LONG-TERM PLAN THAT AIMS AT ISOLATINGAND DRIVING OUT THE VIET CONG . BASIC ELEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'SBATTLE PLAN IS TO RESETTLE ALMOST THE ENTIRE RURAL POPULATION IN SOME12,000 " STRATEGIC HAMLETS, " WITH BAMBOO FENCES, BARBED WIRE AND ARMEDMILITIAMEN TO KEEP THE PREDATORY VIET CONG FROM EXACTING FOOD ANDMANPOWER FROM A HELPLESS PEASANTRY . ALREADY 8,000,000 VILLAGERS 59 PERCENT OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S POPULATION ARE LIVING IN THE 6,000 HAMLETSTHAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN COMPLETED . PROBLEM WITH PEASANTS . THOUGH THEGOVERNMENT ADMITS THAT FEWER THAN ONETHIRD OF THE HAMLETS AREDEFENSIBLE AGAINST A DETERMINED ONSLAUGHT, THE REDS ARE RELUCTANT TOATTACK THE VILLAGES FOR FEAR OF ANTAGONIZING THE PEOPLE . IN SOMEAREAS, THANKS TO HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING IN THE HAMLETS, PEASANTSARE FOR THE FIRST TIME INFORMING GOVERNMENT TROOPS OF THE MOVEMENTS OFTHE VIET CONG . " IF THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE WE CAN PROTECT THEM WITH THEHAMLETS, " SAYS ONE U.S . ADVISER, " OUR PROBLEM MAY BE LICKED . "HOWEVER, MOST SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEASANTS ARE STILL EITHER PASSIVE ORACTIVELY RESENTFUL OF THE DIEM REGIME, WHICH IS OFTEN PERSONIFIED BYOPPRESSIVE, CORRUPT LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS . FOR ALL HIS HIGH HOPES FORTHE PROGRAM, ALOOF, AUTOCRATIC PRESIDENT DIEM SELDOM STIRS FAR FROM HISYELLOW PALACE IN SAIGON TO VISIT THE HINTERLAND AND GENERATE ENTHUSIASMFOR HIS CAUSE .SNEAKY PETES . THE AREA OF THE GOVERNMENT'S GREATEST FRUSTRATION IS THEMEKONG RIVER DELTA, WHERE 55 PER CENT OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S POPULATION ISCENTERED AND 75 PER CENT OF ITS RICE IS GROWN . THE PEASANTS THERE HAVERESISTED THE HAMLET PROGRAM AND HAVE OFTEN BEEN FORCIBLY RESETTLED INFORTIFIED VILLAGES BECAUSE THEY RESENT HAVING TO WALK MILES TO THEIRPADDIES . IN A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON TWO HAMLETS LAST MONTH, SOME 2,000VILLAGERS SIMPLY VANISHED . THE REDS ARE PARTICULARLY HARD TO FLUSH OUTOF THE DELTA BECAUSE THEY OFTEN ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH FROMPEACEFUL PEASANTS . ON THE OTHER HAND, U.S . SPECIAL SERVICE TROOPS "SNEAKY PETES " HAVE MADE DRAMATIC PROGRESS IN THE NORTH BY WINNING OVERAND TRAINING THE DARK-SKINNED, ABORIGINAL MONTAGNARDS . THOUGH THEYHAVE FOR CENTURIES BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE LOWLAND VIETNAMESE, WHOCONTEMPTUOUSLY CALL THEM MOI (SAVAGES), 150,000 MONTAGNARDS NOW BELONGTO AN AGGRESSIVE, NATIVE FORCE . HELP FOR BANANAS . MILITARILY, THEDECISIVE FACTOR IN THE WAR TO DATE HAS BEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME170 U.S.-PILOTED HELICOPTER TRANSPORTS, WHICH GIVE THE GOVERNMENT'STROOPS THE ADVANTAGES OF SURPRISE AND MOBILITY THAT HAD HITHERTO BEENTHE GUERRILLAS' MONOPOLY . THE ANTIQUATED " BANANA " COPTERS HAVEBECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE AS THE VIET CONG LEARN HOW TO USE NEWRAPID-FIRE WEAPONS ; IN ONE SORTIE NEAR THE DELTA VILLAGE OF APBACLAST JANUARY, THEY DOWNED FIVE OF 14 HELICOPTERS, INCLUDING ONE OF THE24 FAST, ROCKET-FIRING HU-1B ( " HUEY " ) HELICOPTERS THAT NOW ESCORTMOST MISSIONS . LAST WEEK A SECOND COMPANY OF 24 HUEYS ARRIVED AT A NEWBASE NEAR VINH LONG . " OPERATIONS WERE DOWN IN THE HUNDREDS A YEARAGO, " SAYS GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, COMMANDER OF U.S . FORCES IN SOUTHVIET NAM . " NOW THEY'RE IN THE THOUSANDS . " BUT NORMAL BATTLEFIELDSTATISTICS ARE LARGELY MEANINGLESS . THE VIET CONG'S CASUALTY RATE ISRISING, BUT THE REDS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED THEIR HARD-CORE STRENGTH(TO AN ESTIMATED 25,000) BY RECRUITING MORE PEASANTS . AND THOUGH THEREDS ARE LOSING MANY WEAPONS, THOSE THAT THEY ARE CAPTURING ARE MODERNMORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS, WHILE THOSE THAT THEY LOSE TO GOVERNMENTFORCES ARE GENERALLY CRUDE DEVICES AND OBSOLETE RIFLES . VAIN PLEAS .AS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS BECOME MORE EFFICIENT, THE WILY VIET CONG AREALSO LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES . ONE OF THE VIET CONG'S LATEST TACTICSHAS BEEN TO MOUNT A SERIES OF FEINTING ATTACKS ON A TARGET, THEN TOWITHDRAW, LURING GOVERNMENT RESERVE FORCES INTO A WELL-LAID AMBUSH . ASA RESULT, BADLY NEEDED REINFORCEMENTS OFTEN HANG BACK FOR FEAR OFWALKING INTO A TRAP . SUCH A WAR IS A NEW AND FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCEFOR U.S . MILITARY ADVISERS . MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT 73 AMERICANSHAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE FIGHTING SO FAR, THEIR MOST BITTERCOMPLAINT IS THAT MILITARY OPERATIONS ARE CONSTANTLY HOBBLED BYPOLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS . THE BIG COMMAND DECISIONS HAVE TO BE CLEAREDWITH PRESIDENT DIEM, WHO STILL LEANS HEAVILY ON SUCH MEMBERS OF HISFAMILY AS BROTHER NGO DINH NHU, AND THE BEAUTEOUS MADAME NHU, FORADVICE AND SUPPORT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS . DIEM ISMISTRUSTFUL OF MANY OF HIS BEST SOLDIERS AND FEARS ALSO THAT CONTINUEDHEAVY CASUALTIES WILL UNDERMINE WHAT PUBLIC SUPPORT HE ENJOYS . U.S .OFFICERS HAVE PLEADED IN VAIN WITH DIEM TO ALLOW MORE SMALL-UNITSALLIES AND NIGHT OPERATIONS TO CHALLENGE THE VIET CONG'S AFTER-DARKSUPREMACY . IN THEIR IMPATIENCE WITH DIEM, SOME EXASPERATED U.S .OFFICIALS WISH THAT HE COULD BE REPLACED BY A MORE FLEXIBLE MAN . BUTTHEY ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO OTHER LEADER IN SIGHT . THE REGIME TENDS TOEXAGGERATE ITS SUCCESSES AND MINIMIZE ITS FAILURES, INSISTS THAT ITSAIRBORNE ATTACKS HAVE FINALLY " DISHEARTENED " THE REDS AND " CAUGHTTHEM OFF BALANCE . " MANY COMBAT-SEASONED U.S . ADVISERS THINK THATTHIS IS HARDLY ENOUGH . " HELL, " SAYS ONE, " IF ALL WE DID WAS TO KEEPTHEM OFF BALANCE ON GUADALCANAL, WE'D STILL BE THERE . " THE ADVISORYWAR . STRATEGICALLY AND POLITICALLY, OF COURSE, THE WAR FOR VIET NAMHAS LITTLE IN COMMON WITH THE BATTLE OF GUADALCANAL . THE U.S . IS NOTRUNNING THE WAR, BUT IS TRYING TO HELP A SENSITIVE YOUNG NATION TO WINFOR ITSELF . IT IS A GUERRILLA WAR IN WHICH, AS PRESIDENT DIEM SAYS, "PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS " MAY PROVE MORE IMPORTANT THAN KILLING THE ENEMYEVEN THOUGH, IN THE U.S . VIEW, HIS REGIME HAS DONE FAR TOO LITTLE, TOOLATE, TO WIN THE SUPPORT OF THE RURAL POPULACE . AFTER PROLONGEDPRESSURE, THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ONLY LAST WEEK TO ASSUME THE $17MILLION ANNUAL COST OF THE HAMLET PROGRAM THE U.S . IN ADDITION HASBEEN SPENDING $400 MILLION A YEAR IN SOUTH VIET NAM AND EVEN THISRELUCTANT DECISION BY DIEM WAS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY FEAR THAT THEVILLAGERS WERE SHOWING GREATER LOYALTY TO U.S . ADMINISTRATORS THAN TOTHE REGIME . DISTRESSING AS THEY MAY BE, THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONBETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS U.S . ADVISERS ARE UNLIKELY TO ABATE .IN FACT, IF THE WAR TURNS MORE CLEARLY IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S FAVOR, THEREGIME WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE IMPATIENT OF U.S . ADVICE . FOR THEVIETNAMESE, IT IS,AFTER ALL, A WARFOR INDEPENDENCE .
