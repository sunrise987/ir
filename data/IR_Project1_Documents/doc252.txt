SOUTH VIET NAM THE MAKESHIFT KILLERS INTO THEVALLEY OF DEATH LAST WEEK FLEW THE 800 . THEY WERE SOUTH VIETNAMESETROOPS BEING LIFTED BY A COMPANY OF U.S . H-21 TROOP-CARRYINGHELICOPTERS TO CLEAN OUT A COMMUNIST-INFESTED JUNGLE HIDEOUT 175 MILESNORTHEAST OF SAIGON . THE REGION WAS A TANGLED, MENACING BATTLEGROUND,WHOSE NAME, LIKE TENNYSON'S BALACLAVA, DERIVES FROM ITS BLOODY HISTORYIN SOUTH VIET NAM'S UGLY GUERRILLA WAR . AS EACH FLIGHT DIPPED INTO THETINY LANDING ZONE, AN ESCORT OF TWELVE ROCKETCARRYING UH 1-B ( " HUEY ") CHOPPERS SPRAYED THE SCRUBBY UNDERBRUSH WITH ROCKETS AND MACHINE-GUNFIRE . NOT A SINGLE HOSTILE SHOT WAS RETURNED AS THE TROOPS HIT THEGROUND AND FANNED INTO THE JUNGLE . THE ABSENCE OF ENEMY OPPOSITION INTHE LANDING AREA COULD BE LARGELY TRACED TO VIET CONG FEAR OF THEROCKET-CARRYING HUEYS . BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL IN SOUTH VIET NAM LASTFALL, DEVASTATING COMMUNIST GROUND FIRE AGAINST THE LUMBERING,DEFENSELESS H-21S THREATENED TO HALT THE GOVERNMENT'S HELICOPTERAIRLIFT CAMPAIGN, WHICH HAD BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE OFFENSIVE TACTICAGAINST THE RED GUERRILLAS . RELUCTANTLY THE TOP U.S . MILITARY BRASS,WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SKEPTICAL THAT A HELICOPTER COULD EVER BE A DEADLYOFFENSIVE WEAPON, THREW THE NEWLYARRIVED HUEYS INTO COMBAT . THEIRMISSION : TO ESCORT AND PROTECT THE TROOPCARRYING COPTERS . " THE MOSTESSENTIAL UNIT . " SO EFFECTIVE HAVE THE HUEYS BEEN IN COUNTERACTINGVIET CONG GROUND FIRE THAT SOME H-21 PILOTS HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY OUTMISSIONS RATHER THAN FLY WITHOUT HUEY ESCORTS . SINCE LAST OCTOBER, THEHUEYS HAVE FLOWN 3,600 SORTIES, FIRED 1,800 ROCKETS AND 200,000 ROUNDSOF MACHINEGUN AMMUNITION, AND KILLED COUNTLESS HUNDREDS OF REDS . TWOENLISTED MEN OF THE COMPANY (WHOSE OFFICIAL MILITARY DESIGNATION ISUTILITY TACTICAL TRANSPORT COMPANY) HAVE BEEN KILLED IN COMBAT, AND 19OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 113-MAN UNIT HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHEDFLYING CROSS . TODAY U.S . MILITARY OFFICIALS ESTIMATE THAT, ALTHOUGHTHE VIET CONG HAS DOUBLED ITS ANTIAIRCRAFT EFFORT IN THE PAST YEAR, THETROOP-CARRYING CHOPPERS ARE SUFFERING 25 PER CENT FEWER HITS THANBEFORE THE HUEYS ARRIVED ON THE VIET NAM SCENE . " THE HUEYS, " SAYSGENERAL PAUL HARKINS, THE CAPABLE BOSS OF THE 14,000 U.S . ADVISERS INSOUTH VIET NAM, " ARE THE MOST ESSENTIAL UNIT IN MY COMMAND . " THEIRONY OF THE HUEYS' SUCCESS IS THAT THEY ARE MAKESHIFT KILLERS,ORIGINALLY DESIGNED AS UTILITY AIRCRAFT AND PERSONNEL CARRIERS . BUTHUEY PILOTS BECAME CONVINCED THAT THEIR SPEEDY, MANEUVERABLE CHOPPERSWOULD BE IDEAL SUPPORT AIRCRAFT IN THE KIND OF GUERRILLA WAR SITUATIONTHAT SOUTHEAST ASIA PRESENTS . ON THEIR OWN, COMPANY PERSONNELOUTFITTED THEIR HUEYS WITH 16 HOMEMADE ROCKET MOUNTS AND FOURMACHINE-GUN BRACKETS, PESTERED DUBIOUS BRASS FOR MONTHS TO LET THEM TRYOUT THEIR IDEAS IN ACTION . THE HUEYS' EFFECTIVENESS IS MAINLY THERESULT OF THEIR ABILITY TO CHUG RIGHT ALONG IN THE SAME FORMATION WITHTHE H-21S . UNLIKE FIXED-WING FIGHTER BOMBERS, WHICH FLY TOO HIGH ANDTOO FAST TO PICK OUT SPECIFIC TARGETS AND SOMETIMES DROP NAPALM ONINNOCENT CIVILIANS, THE SLOWCRUISING HUEYS CAN SPOT GROUND FIRE IN THELANDING ZONE AND MOVE IN TO NEUTRALIZE IT WITH DISCRIMINATING FIRE THATSPARES NONCOMBATANTS . " IF WE KILL ONE WOMAN OR A CHILD ON A MISSIONAND 90 VIET CONG, " SAYS ONE HUEY PILOT, " THEN THAT MISSION IS AFAILURE . " PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT . AS A PREVIOUSLY UNTRIED COMBATINNOVATION, THE HUEYS CAN AFFORD TO EXPERIMENT IN HELIBORNE ASSAULTTACTICS, ARE PROVIDING THE ARMY WITH INVALUABLE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCEIN NEW DOCTRINES OF GUERRILLA WARFARE . " WE'RE WRITING THE BOOK OFTACTICS OURSELVES, " SAYS MAJOR IVAN SLAVICH, 35, COMMANDING OFFICER OFTHE U.T.T . COMPANY . IN COMBAT, THE HUEYS USUALLY FLY A CIRCULAR "DAISY CHAIN " PATTERN SO THAT EACH SHIP IS ALWAYS COVERED BY THECHOPPER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT . " OUR MACHINE GUNS HAVE MORE ACTUALKILLING POWER, " SAYS SLAVICH . " BUT OUR ROCKETS SEEM TO HAVE A MUCHGREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON THE VIET CONG . /THE MAKESHIFT KILLERS WITH THEIR MANEUVERABILITY, THE HUEYSCAN SLIDE BACK AND FORTH JUST A FEW FEET OVER THE SUN-SCORCHED RICEFIELDS, SORTING OUT THEIR TARGETS LIKE COWBOYS CUTTING STEERS FROM AHERD . ON ONE RECENT MISSION, THE DESPERATE REDS TRIED TO LOB HANDGRENADES INTO THE OPEN SIDE DOORS OF THE LOW-CIRCLING CHOPPERS . WHENTWO HUEYS TRIED TO BOX IN AND CAPTURE A FLEEING RED GUERRILLA, HESUDDENLY WHEELED AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM, A HAND GRENADE IN EACHHAND . A BURST OF GUNFIRE FROM THE CHOPPERS CUT HIM DOWN ; BOTHGRENADES EXPLODED BENEATH HIS BODY . FROM THE DOOR OF A GRASS HUT, AGUERRILLA BLAZED AWAY AT A HOVERING HUEY, MISSED ITS COPILOT BY ONLY AFEW INCHES . THE HUEY'S WINGMAN PLANTED A ROCKET SMACK IN THE DOORWAYOF THE HUT AND BLEW IT TO PIECES . SCARED PRINCESS . THE CHOPPER PILOTSCREDIT SLAVICH FOR THE OUTSTANDING SUCCESS OF THE HUEYS, CALL THEIROUTFIT " SLAVICH'S PEOPLE . " SON OF A RETIRED SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATICWARD POLITICIAN, SLAVICH SERVED AS A MARINE CORPS ENLISTED MAN AFTERWORLD WAR II, BECAME AN ARMY OFFICER AFTER GRADUATION FROM THEUNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN 1951 . HE WON A COMBAT INFANTRYMAN'SBADGE IN KOREA, BECAME A PILOT IN 1955, TOOK COMMAND OF THE U.T.T .COMPANY LAST NOVEMBER . SLAVICH RUNS AN EASYGOING OUTFIT AT HIS BASE ATTHE EDGE OF SAIGON AIRPORT . LIKE TOURISTS, SOME PILOTS TOTE CAMERAS ONMISSIONS, AND SLAVICH HIMSELF USED TO TAKE HIS GERMAN SHEPHERD,PRINCESS, ALONG ON SORTIES UNTIL THE PUP BECAME SO SHELL-SHY THAT SHENEARLY JUMPED OUT OF THE CHOPPER WHEN THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED . THEPILOTS HAVE A JARGON OF THEIR OWN . THEY " ZAP " THE VIET CONG ON AGOOD DAY, CALL SAIGON " THE VILLE, " EXPRESS FERVENT APPROVAL OFEVERYTHING FROM A GIRL TO A CHOPPER WITH THE WORD " OUTSTANDIN' . "TOP-RANKING VISITORS OFTEN HITCH RIDES ON THEIR FLIGHTS TO GET IN A FEWPERSONAL LICKS AT THE VIET CONG . BRIGADIER GENERAL JOSEPH STILWELLJR., SON OF " VINEGAR JOE, " FREQUENTLY RIDES SHOTGUN IN SLAVICH'S OWNCHOPPER . ONCE, WITH STILWELL ABOARD, SLAVICH HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCYLANDING IN A RED-INFESTED AREA . " I WAS SCARED TO DEATH, " SAIDSLAVICH . GLAD THE VIET CONG DIDN'T COME ALONG, BECAUSE I KNOW DAMNWELL THAT GENERAL STILWELL WOULD HAVE MADE US FIGHT FOR THE MACHINEINSTEAD OF LETTING US RUN . " / PUCKER UP & PRAY . " DEADLY AS THEHUEYS ARE, THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS . AS BOTH DOORS MUST BE KEPT WIDEOPEN TO GIVE THE AUTOMATIC RIFLE-TOTING SIDE GUNNERS COMPLETEVISIBILITY, THE BLAST OF THE ROCKETS CREATES AN EAR-SHATTERING DIN INTHE COPTER'S CABIN . EVEN WORSE, THE HUEYS ARE VIRTUALLY UNARMORED, ANDENEMY FLAK CUTS THROUGH THEM EASILY . ALL FOUR CREWMEN NOT ONLY WEARFLAK VESTS BUT ALSO SIT ON A PILE OF VESTS TO PROTECT PRIVATE PARTS . "WHEN AN ENEMY IS SHOOTING AT YOU AT THAT LOW ALTITUDE, IT'S THE MOSTHOPELESS FEELING IN THE WORLD, " SAYS ONE PILOT . " THERE'S NOTHING TODO BUT PUCKER UP AND PRAY . " BUT BECAUSE OF THE HUEYS' PERFORMANCE,THE ARMY IS NOW ENCOURAGING THE DESIGN OF A MUCH BETTER, ARMORED,ATTACK HELICOPTER, WHICH MIGHT ACHIEVE SPEEDS OF 175 KNOTS AND EMPLOYHEAVIER MACHINE GUNS AND PERMANENTLY INSTALLED TURRETS FOR THE LETHALROCKETS . FROM MAJOR SLAVICH COMES THE RATIONALE FOR SUCH AN AIRCRAFT ./ WE CAN STAY IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THE HELICOPTERS WE AREPROTECTING, " HE SAID . " WE CAN WORK IN CLOSE, WE CAN WORK INUNLIMITED VISIBILITY, WE CAN VARY OUR AIRSPEED FROM 100 KNOTS TO ZERO .WE CAN SEEK AND FIND A HOSTILE MENACE TO HELICOPTERS BETTER THAN ANYONEELSE . /
