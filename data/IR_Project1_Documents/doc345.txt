HUNGARY " HUMANIZING " COMMUNISM AFTER THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1848SWEPT THE CONTINENT, HUNGARIAN PATRIOT LAJOS KOSSUTH SAID THAT HISCOUNTRYMEN WERE THE " REDDEST REPUBLICANS IN EUROPE . " TODAY, SEVENYEARS AFTER RUSSIAN TANKS CRUSHED THE HUNGARIAN REVOLT, HUNGARY'S 14MILLION PEOPLE ARE FAST BECOMING EUROPE'S MOST REPUBLICAN REDS .WESTERN INFLUENCES POP UP EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . DESPITE ASCARCITY OF EGGS AND MEAT, STORE WINDOWS DISPLAY ELIZABETH ARDENCOSMETICS, NAPOLEON BRANDY AND A SELECTION OF SCOTCH . MODERN ART HANGSON GALLERY WALLS, AND NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP HAS BEEN RELAXED ; WHENPRESIDENT KENNEDY'S SISTERS, PAT LAWFORD AND JEAN SMITH, VISITEDBUDAPEST, TELEVISION AND RADIO CREWS DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS .RESTRICTIONS AGAINST TRAVEL TO THE WEST HAVE BEEN EASED ; LONG LINESOF VISA APPLICANTS DAILY QUEUE UP OUTSIDE WESTERN EMBASSIES INBUDAPEST, AND IT IS NOW CHIC FOR VACATIONING HUNGARIAN COUPLES TO AGREETO MEET IN VENICE . HUNGARY'S NEW LOOK IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF EFFORTSBY PREMIER JANOS KADAR TO WIPE OUT THE STAIN OF HAVING PERSONALLYCALLED IN RUSSIAN TROOPS AND TANKS TO SUPPRESS THE 1956 REVOLUTION .HAVING FOUND THAT A LIGHTER YOKE YIELDS GREATER ECONOMIC PROSPERITY ANDLESS POLITICAL UNREST, KADAR HAS MADE HUNGARY NEXT TO POLAND THE MOSTLIBERAL OF THE SATELLITE REGIMES . THAT, OF COURSE, IS STILL VERY MUCHA RELATIVE MATTER, BUT HUNGARIANS ARE GRATEFUL FOR SMALL FAVORS . "TIMES CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, " SAYS ONE . " THE REVOLT WAS NOT INVAIN . " SUBTLE REVISION.KADAR'S NEW STANCE HAS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECTAT THE U.N., WHICH SINCE 1956 HAS REFUSED TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THECREDENTIALS OF KADAR'S U.N . DELEGATES (THOUGH THEY ACTUALLY TAKE PARTIN DEBATES AND VOTE) . THE FINAL TRACE OF U.N . DISAPPROVAL DISAPPEAREDRECENTLY WHEN SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT SPENT THREE DAYS IN HUNGARY ANDSEVEN HOURS WITH KADAR HIMSELF . EVEN THE U.S., UNABLE TO ROUND UPCONTINUED SUPPORT TO BLOCK HUNGARIAN ACCREDITATION, WILL NOT OPPOSE THEOFFICIAL SEATING OF HUNGARY'S DELEGATION AT THE NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLYSESSION . AIMING TO " HUMANIZE COMMUNISM, " KADAR HAS SACKED STALINISTPOLITICAL HACKS, APPOINTED NON-COMMUNISTS TO CABINET POSTS, AND ALLOWEDNONPARTY MEMBERS TO SERVE IN THE PARLIAMENT . HE HAS GRANTED AMNESTY TOTHOUSANDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ENCOURAGED REFUGEES WHO FLED IN1956 TO RETURN WITH FREE PARDONS ; TODAY THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THATMORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF 1956'S 200,000 REFUGEES HAVE COME BACK HOME .WORKER MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS NOT A SURE GUARANTEE OFSUCCESS . " WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE RED BLOODS THE SAME PRIVILEGE ONCEENJOYED BY BLUEBLOODS, " SAYS KADAR . TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON U.S .DIPLOMATS IN BUDAPEST HAVE BEEN LIFTED, ENABLING THEM TO GO ANYWHERE INTHE COUNTRY EXCEPT TO MILITARY ZONES . DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BEINGCARRIED ON WITH THE VATICAN OVER THE FUTURE OF JOSEF CARDINALMINDSZENTY, WHO IS STILL IN ASYLUM AT THE U.S . LEGATION AND WHOM THEGOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY . FIRST SIGNS OF A RAPPORT WITHROME APPEARED WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD APPROVE POPEPAUL'S ASSIGNMENT OF SIX NEW CATHOLIC BISHOPS TO VACANT HUNGARIAN SEES. BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO LET OTHER BISHOPS AND SOME 1,000PRIESTS PERFORM THEIR DUTIES . OFF TO BELGRADE . MORE THAN 90 PER CENTOF HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN COLLECTIVIZED, BUT FARMERS CAN USESTATE MACHINERY TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN TINY PLOTS . INCREASINGLY, THEGOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CHANNEL A LARGER PART OF THE ECONOMY INTO THEPRODUCTION OF CONSUMER GOODS . TODAY SOME HUNGARIAN GYPSIES ACTUALLYHAVE TV SETS THOUGH THEY OFTEN GO AROUND BAREFOOT . HUNGARY, OF COURSE,IS STILL A TOTALITARIAN STATE . WATCHTOWERS, MINEFIELDS AND BARBED-WIRESEAL OFF THE COUNTRY FROM THE WEST . THOUGH THE MIDNIGHT KNOCK BY THESECRET POLICE IS ALMOST A THING OF THE PAST, MORE THAN 40,000 RUSSIANTROOPS AND THE HIDEOUS MEMORY OF 1956 STILL REMAIN . KADAR STEADFASTLYFOLLOWS EVERY NEW TWIST OF KREMLIN POLICY . NO SOONER HAD NIKITAKHRUSHCHEV LEFT YUGOSLAVIA AFTER MAKING HIS PEACE WITH MARSHAL TITOTHAN KADAR MADE PLANS TO VISIT BELGRADE THIS WEEK, SEEKING TOSTRENGTHEN HUNGARY'S ECONOMIC, DIPLOMATIC AND CULTURAL TIES WITH THEONETIME " REVISIONIST " BAD BOY OF THE SATELLITES . NEVER IN HUNGARY .BUT KADAR'S LIBERALIZATION DOES PERMIT HUNGARIANS TO LAUGH ATTHEMSELVES AND AT THEIR REGIME AS LONG AS COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY ITSELF ISNOT ATTACKED . IN THE LATEST ISSUE OF THE HUNGARIAN SATIRICAL WEEKLYLUDAS MATYI, THE EDITORS REFLECT ON BRITAIN'S RECENT $7,000,000 MAILTRAIN ROBBERY AND CONCLUDE THAT IT COULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN HUNGARY. " WE LACK ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR IT, " SAID THE MAGAZINE . " FIRST,OF THE 30 MEN IN THE GANG, AT LEAST FOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT SICK,EIGHT WOULD HAVE GONE BY MISTAKE TO ANOTHER RAILWAY EMBANKMENT, ANDTHREE WOULD HAVE TELEGRAPHED FROM LAKE BALATON THAT THEY COULD NOT COMEFOR TWO DAYS . IT WOULD ALSO NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO COVER THE GREENTRACK SIGNAL BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A COVER SHORTAGE . IN ADDITION, AMAIL TRAIN HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO HOURS LATE . THE BANDITS LOADED THEMONEY THEY STOLE IN A TRUCK . THEY COULD DO THAT IN ENGLAND, BUT HERE,WHERE THE TRUCK SERVICE STATIONS ARE THREE MONTHS BEHIND IN THEIR WORK,WHAT COULD THEY HAVE LOADED THE BAGS ON ? /
