EUROPE THIS WAS THE SUMMER THAT WAS " SUMMER'S LEASE HATHALL TOO SHORT A DATE, " SIGHED SHAKESPEARE IN THE 18TH SONNET, BUT ASFAR AS MOST OF WESTERN EUROPE IS CONCERNED, THE SOONER THE LEASE RUNSOUT THE BETTER . AFTER ONE OF THE WORST WINTERS IN MEMORY, THIS SUMMERHAS PROVED A THING OF WIND AND WETNESS, OF A COOL JULY AND AUGUSTSNOWS, OF RECORD RAINS AND BLIGHTED HARVESTS, OF BURGEONING PRICES ANDOTHER IRRITANTS . IF SUCH CRISES OF DAILY LIVING WERE MINOR COMPAREDWITH THE TEST BAN TREATY OR SOUTH VIET NAM, THEY STILL MEANT ADIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD TIMES AND BAD FOR MILLIONS OF OTHERWISEFLOURISHING EUROPEANS . .BRITAIN . PLAINLY, THE SEASIDE WAS FIT ONLYFOR THE FISH, AND HOTELKEEPERS REPORTED THAT BOOKINGS WERE OFF 15Q6 .FOR THE HARDY SOULS WHO WENT, GETTING THERE WAS NO FUN EITHER, SINCEBRITAIN HAS ONLY 250 MILES OF SUPERHIGHWAYS (COMPARED WITH GERMANY'S1,870) . SINCE A SWEEPING MOTORWAYS PLAN WAS ADOPTED SEVEN YEARS AGO,THE BRITISH HAVE BEEN BUILDING ROADS AT MODEL T RATES, AND PLANNERSPALE AT THE THOUGHT THAT BY 1980 THE CURRENT CAR POPULATION OF6,000,000 WILL HAVE TREBLED . MOTORISTS GROW PLAE AT A MORE IMMEDIATEPROSPECT : " TRANSPORT MINISTER ERNEST MARPLES' PLAN TO IMPOSEPARKING-METER CHARGES OF 35 #$ AN HOUR IN PARTS OF LONDON . PERHAPSMOST SYMBOLIC OF BRITAIN'S SUMMERTIME COMPLAINTS WAS THE STUTTERINGPROGRESS ON THE RENOVATION OF NO . 10 DOWNING STREET, RESIDENCE OFBRITISH PRIME MINISTERS SINCE 1735 . A PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONPRONOUNCED THE PLACE A " HORROR " IN 1958, PACKED HAROLD MACMILLAN OFFTO NEARBY ADMIRALTY HOUSE BEFORE THE FLOOR GAVE WAY BENEATH HIM,ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE TWO YEARS AND $1,100,000 TO REPAIR THEBUILDING . BUT NO END IS IN SIGHT AFTER FIVE YEARS AND $8,500,000 .MATTERS WERE NOT HELPED BY 14 WORK STOPPAGES . BUT THEN, THE BUILDINGWORKERS WERE ONLY FOLLOWING A PATTERN, FOR THIS, AFTER ALL, WAS THESUMMER WHEN EVEN THE BEEFEATERS IN THE TOWER STRUCK FOR HIGHER WAGES ..FRANCE . WHAT MOST EXASPERATED FRENCHMEN WAS THE FOUL WEATHER . INBIARRITZ, 400 HOUSES WERE FLOODED IN ONE DAY, AND IN THE SOMMEDEPARTMENT, A VACATIONER DIED OF EXPOSURE WHEN HE FOOLHARDILY WENTSWIMMING . THERE WAS ALSO THE WINE CRISIS (SEE WORLD BUSINESS) AND FEAROF INFLATION . THE LATEST PRICE INCREASES AFFECTED BREAD AND POSTAGESTAMPS ; SINCE CHARLES DE GAULLE CAME TO POWER IN 1958, THE PRICES OF250 ESSENTIAL ARTICLES HAVE CLIMBED 25 PER CENT , EXCLUDING RENTS,WHICH HAVE SOARED 82 PER CENT . PARIS NEWSPAPERS SPOKE OF A " GRAVECRISIS, " BUT THE GOVERNMENT PUT OFF A SCHEDULED DISCUSSION OF THEECONOMIC SITUATION UNTIL MIDMONTH, WHEN AT LEAST THE WEATHER MAY BEBETTER . .GERMANY . DESPITE THE ABUNDANCE OF FOUR-LANE, CEMENT-PAVEDAUTOBAHNEN, WHICH ARE BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE AT THE EDGES, 10 MILLIONCARS OWNED BY PROSPERING WEST GERMANS AND COUNTLESS TOURIST AUTOSCLOGGED THE ROADS IN WHAT DER SPIEGEL CALLED " THE LONGEST TRAFFIC JAMIN THE HISTORY OF THE OCCIDENT . " ONE TIE-UP STRETCHED 20 MILES,INVOLVED 4,100 CARS . SOME MOTORISTS HAVE BEEN SEEN DRAWING WATER FROMNEARBY BROOKS AND WASHING THEIR CARS WHILE WAITING FOR TRAFFIC TO GETMOVING . WHAT SADDENS SOME GERMANS EVEN MORE THAN THE TRAFFIC IS THENEWS THAT MORE THAN 200 OF THE ANCIENT DWELLINGS IN HEIDELBERG'SALTSTADT THE " OLD TOWN " WHERE GENERATIONS OF HEIDELBERG STUDENTSLOVED TO STROLL ARE NEAR COLLAPSE FROM NEGLECT AND FUNGUS ROT . LOATHTO DESTROY THE ALTSTADT (AND ALONG WITH IT A LUCRATIVE TOURIST TRADE),HEIDELBERGERS ARE EQUALLY RELUCTANT TO TRY TO RAISE THE $50 MILLIONNEEDED TO RESTORE THE BUILDINGS . .ITALY . SUMMER SKIES WERE SUNNY INITALY, BUT THAT CREATED ITS OWN PROBLEMS . TOURISTS FLEEING FROM THEFROZEN NORTH CREATED COLOSSAL TRAFFIC JAMS AT THE BRENNER PASS ANDTHREE-HOUR TIE-UPS ALONG OTHER ROADS . ITALIANS WHO FLOCKED TOSARDINIA'S MUCH-BALLYHOOED COSTA ESMERALDA, WHERE THE AGA KHAN ISBUILDING A RESORT, FOUND THEMSELVES QUARTERED IN HALF-FINISHED HOTELSWITH NEITHER LIGHTS NOR HOT WATER . AND THE ANNUAL CRUSH OF GERMANTOURISTS NEVER QUITE MATERIALIZED . OFFENDED BY A RASH OF ITALIAN-MADEANTI-GERMAN FILMS, SOME GERMAN NEWSPAPERS ADVISED THEIR READERS TO TAKETHEIR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE . THOUSANDS DID SO, HEADED FOR YUGOSLAVIAINSTEAD . .THE LOW COUNTRIES . IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE WEATHER HURT THECORN CROP AND STUNTED DUTCH BULBS, DRAINING THEM OF THEIR BRILLIANTHUES . IN BELGIUM, THE FLAX CROP IS BAD, AND THE WHEAT HARVEST IN SOMEPLACES IS ONE-FOURTH ITS NORMAL SIZE . BUT OF GREATER CONCERN TO THEBELGIANS THAN THE MEAGER HARVEST OR THE TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER WAS A NEWLAW THAT GOES INTO EFFECT THIS WEEK, CREATING A FORMAL LANGUAGE BARRIERACROSS THE LAND . DUTCH WILL BE THE OFFICIAL TONGUE IN THE FLEMISHNORTH, FRENCH IN THE WALLOON-DOMINATED SOUTH, WITH POCKETS OF BOTHPEOPLES STRANDED ON THE WRONG SIDE . MONTHS OF DEMONSTRATIONSCULMINATED LAST WEEK WHEN HUNDREDS OF FLEMINGS CLASHED WITH WALLOONS ATOSTEND . IT WAS THE BEER-BIBBING BELGIANS, WHOSE PER-CAPITA INFLOW OF34.3 GALLONS IS THE WORLD'S HIGHEST, WHO PUT A FOAMY HEAD ON ADISHEARTENING SUMMER . THEY SCHEDULED A NATIONAL BEER FESTIVAL AT THECHATEAU DE FRAITURE IN LIEGE PROVINCE, BUT BEFORE THE GUZZLING COULDEVEN GET STARTED, THE CHATEAU BURNED DOWN, LOCK, STOCK AND BEER BARRELS
