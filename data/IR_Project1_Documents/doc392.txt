GREAT BRITAIN ANOTHER TORY SETBACK DUNDEE, A DOUR, SLUM-RIDDENINDUSTRIAL CITY (POP . 182,900) ON SCOTLAND'S EAST COAST, IS FAMED FORITS MARMALADE AND MAVERICK POLITICS . IT HAS SENT ONLY TWO TORY M.P.STO WESTMINSTER IN 131 YEARS, AND IN 1922 THREW OUT WINSTON CHURCHILL,THEN A LIBERAL, IN FAVOR OF THE ONLY PROHIBITIONIST EVER TO SIT INPARLIAMENT . IN 1959 THE LABOR PARTY ONLY MANAGED TO HANG ONTO DUNDEEBY 714 VOTES, AND SO, IN LAST WEEK'S BY-ELECTION, THE TORIES HAD HOPESTHAT THE IMPACT OF A NEW, SCOTTISH PRIME MINISTER MIGHT HELP TO DEFEATLABOR . INSTEAD, THE GOVERNMENT SUFFERED ANOTHER SETBACK . THEPROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE, A POPULAR LAWYER, LOST TO HISLABORITE OPPONENT, A TRADE-UNION OFFICIAL, BY 4,955 VOTES, A TORY DROPOF 8.8 PER CENT FROM THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION . PART OF THE OUTCOMEWAS CAUSED BY PURELY LOCAL ISSUES (EXAMPLE : RECENT GOVERNMENTPROPOSALS TO LOWER PROTECTIVE TARIFFS ON JUTE, WHICH WOULD JEOPARDIZEAN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS 20 PER CENT OF THE CITY'S WORK FORCE), AND THELOSS WAS NOT AS SHARP AS THE TORIES' RECENT DEFEAT AT THRIVING,MIDDLE-CLASS LUTON . BUT THE TORIES WERE PAINFULLY AWARE THAT THEY HAVELITTLE TIME TO REVERSE LABOR'S GAINS BEFORE ELECTIONS, PROBABLY NEXTSPRING . . . . (TRIDOTS) ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR TORY LEADERS,ELFIN-FACED, EFFERVESCENT VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, LAST WEEK FOLLOWED THEEXAMPLE OF FORMER LORD HOME, SIGNED AWAY HIS TITLES AND BECAME THERIGHT HONORABLE QUINTIN HOGG .
