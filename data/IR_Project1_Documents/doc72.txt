HUNGARY GAY UNTIL TOMORROW LIKE GERMANY'S RIOTOUS FASCHINGFESTIVAL, HUNGARY'S FARSANG WAS TRADITIONALLY A TIME TO BLOW OFF STEAMBEFORE THE ONSET OF LENT'S RIGORS . IT WAS BANNED BY HUNGARY'S REDRULERS . BUT NOW, WITH THEIR TOLERANCE, FARSANG (PRONOUNCED FORSHONG),IS MAKING A COMEBACK NOT SO MUCH AS A PRE-LENTEN SPREE AS A CHANCE TOESCAPE THE AUSTERITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE UNDER COMMUNISM . EXPLAINED ONEBLONDE MERRYMAKER : " WE CELEBRATE FROM THE MORNING AFTER NEW YEAR'SRIGHT THROUGH LENT, AND ON TO EASTER . " HUNGARY'S FESTIVAL PALES BYCOMPARISON WITH THE OLD DAYS, WHEN MAGYAR ARISTOCRATS WOULD SPIT ON A100-FORINT NOTE (WORTH ABOUT $12.50), SLAP IT ON A GYPSY'S FOREHEAD,AND DEMAND PASSIONATE VIOLINPLAYING UNTIL THE SPITTLE DRIED AND THENOTE FELL OFF . BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, IT IS GAY ENOUGH . ATBUDAPEST'S PRESS BALL LAST WEEK, YOUNG MEN IN STOVEPIPE TROUSERS ANDGIRLS IN DARINGLY DECOLLETE DRESSES PERFORMED A WRITHING TWIST THATONLOOKERS POINTED TO WITH A TOUCH OF PRIDE AS THEIR OWN " DIRTY TWIST ./ FOR THE MONSTER MASKED BALLS THAT PUNCTUATE THE SEASON, PROBABLY100,000 COSTUMES WILL BE RENTED . AT SOME EVENTS THE MEN SPORT TUXEDOSRENTED FOR 120 FORINTS (THE AVERAGE HUNGARIAN EARNS 1,600 FORINTS AMONTH, OR $70 AT TOURIST EXCHANGE RATES), AND THE LADIES WEAR OLDREMODELED PARTY DRESSES . EVERYBODY THROWS A PARTY : THERE IS EVEN ABALL OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF WATER ECONOMY .
