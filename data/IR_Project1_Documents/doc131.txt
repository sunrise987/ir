GREAT BRITAIN THE ANGRY ONES HEY NONNY NO ! TRILLED THE TORYDAILY MAIL ONE MORNING LAST WEEK . AFTER THE BITTEREST WINTER IN 50YEARS, DAFFODILS WERE BLOOMING IN LONDON'S PARKS, AND GOVERNMENTOFFICIALS REPORTED WITH RELIEF THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD DROPPED,FROM 3.9 PER CENT TO 3.1 PER CENT , FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THANSIX MONTHS . THEIR JUBILATION WAS SHORT-LIVED . IN A RITE OF SPRINGSUCH AS BRITAIN HAS NOT WITNESSED SINCE THE DEPRESSION, MORE THAN 5,000JOBLESS WORKERS CONVERGED ON LONDON TO PROTEST THEIR PLIGHT, TOUCHINGOFF AN UGLY, ROCK-THROWING BATTLE AT THE VERY DOOR OF PARLIAMENT .RAISING THE FLAG . IT ALL BEGAN PEACEFULLY ENOUGH WITH A BANNER-WAVINGPARADE TOWARD WESTMINSTER, WHERE WORKERS' LEADERS WERE DETERMINED TOCARRY PERSONAL PROTESTS TO THEIR M.P.S . AWKWARDLY AT FIRST, MANYFINGERING THE CLOTH CAPS THAT ARE THE TRADITIONAL BADGE OF THE BRITISHWORKINGMAN, THEY STOOD TALKING UNTIL THE HOUSE OF COMMONS' BIG CENTRALLOBBY WAS JAMMED, WHILE A SURGING MOB OF WORKERS STILL OUTSIDE JOSTLEDIMPATIENTLY TO GET THROUGH ST . STEPHEN'S DOORWAY . WHEN 500 HASTILYSUMMONED FOOT AND MOUNTED POLICE TRIED TO FORCE THEM BACK, THE PROTESTDEMONSTRATION EXPLODED INTO A SAVAGE, THREE-HOUR MELEE PROVOKED PARTLYBY COMMUNISTS IN THE CROWD . CRYING " FASCISTS " AND " GESTAPO, " THEWORKERS DROPPED LIGHTED CIGARETTES INTO POLICE HORSES' MOUTHS, TRIED TODRAG THE COPS FROM THEIR MOUNTS, HURLED HORSE MANURE AT THEM . SOMEYOUNG WORKERS CLIMBED ONTO THE STONE FIGURES AROUND THE ENTRANCE, ANDONE COMMUNIST AGITATOR EVEN HAULED UP A RED FLAG . WHEN A POLICE CORDONFORCED THEM AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS AFTER SIX CHARGES, HUNDREDS OFDEMONSTRATORS STAGED A SITDOWN STRIKE IN THE ROAD . THE CROWD INCLUDEDKILTED SCOTSMEN AND OLD-AGE PENSIONERS, APPRENTICES, MILL GIRLS ANDGRIZZLED STEELWORKERS . MOST CAME FROM THE NORTHERN SHIPBUILDING ANDSTEELMAKING CITIES OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND, WHERE THEMISERY OF THE 1930S IS NOT FORGOTTEN . LAST WEEK, BY CONTRAST WITH THEHUNGER MARCHES OF THAT ERA, MOST ARRIVED BY TRAIN OR BUS ; SOME EVENCAME BY PLANE . SAID A SCOTTISH MINER : " WE ARE NOT HUNGRY MEN ASKINGFOR FOOD . WE ARE ANGRY MEN ASKING FOR SELF-RESPECT . " GETTING INTOPOLITICS . THEY POINTED OUT THAT THOUGH WARM WEATHER HAS BOOSTEDEMPLOYMENT IN HOMEBUILDING AND HEAVY CONSTRUCTION, THE ACTUAL TOTAL OFUNEMPLOYED (702,000) IN BRITAIN WAS STILL 250,000 HIGHER THAN IN THEPREVIOUS MARCH, AND WAS ACTUALLY RISING IN THE WORST-HIT NORTHERN AREAS. ANOTHER RALLY NEXT DAY BY SOME 5,000 TEACHERS DEMANDING A WAGE RAISESHOWED THAT DISENCHANTMENT WITH HAROLD MACMILLAN'S CONSERVATIVEGOVERNMENT IS EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD . IT WAS FAR TOO EARLY TO PREDICTTHE IMPACT OF ALL THIS ON THE COMING ELECTIONS, WHICH WILL PROBABLYTAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR . BUT MACMILLAN HARDLY WELCOMED THE DEMONSTRATIONSON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER RECENT BAD NEWS : THREE BY-ELECTION REVERSESIN A FORTNIGHT, AND A NEW GALLUP POLL REPORT ON VOTER PREFERENCESHOWING THAT THE LABOR PARTY HOLDS A RECORD 16.5 PER CENT LEAD OVER THETORIES .
