AFRICA TOGETHER AT THE " SUMMIT " THE NORMALLY SLEEPY ETHIOPIANCAPITAL OF ADDIS ABABA WAS ASTIR WITH FEVERISH ACTIVITY LAST WEEK .CROWDS OF RAGGED CITIZENS STOOD GAPING AS WORKMEN RUSHED TO INSTALLHUGE PORTRAITS OF PROMINENT AFRICANS ACROSS FROM HAILE SELASSIE'SPALACE . FINISHING TOUCHES WERE BEING PUT ON A SPANKING NEW HOTEL .MILE AFTER MILE OF 8-FT.-HIGH CORRUGATED IRON FENCE WAS BEING PUT INPLACE ALONG MAIN STREETS TO HIDE THE CITY'S SHABBY SLUMS . ALL THEEXCITEMENT WAS IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS WEEK'S PAN-AFRICAN " SUMMIT "CONFERENCE OF SOME 30 AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE . NEVER BEFORE HAD SO MANYLEADERS OF AFRICA SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME, ANDTHEIR PROUD HOST, THE AGING (70) ETHIOPIAN EMPEROR, WAS OUT AT THEAIRPORT IN PERSON WITH HIS GREEN-ANDBLACK ROLLS-ROYCE TO GREET MANY OFHIS ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS, INCLUDING LIBERIA'S PRESIDENT WILLIAM V .SHADRACH TUBMAN, WHO ARRIVED FIVE DAYS EARLY SO AS TO SQUEEZE IN ASTATE VISIT . THE GUEST LIST WAS A WHO'S WHO OF AFRICA'S SUCCESSFULREVOLUTIONARIES AND MODERATE NATION BUILDERS . GHANA'S EGOCENTRICOSAGYEFO (REDEEMER), KWAME NKRUMAH, WAS DUE IN FROM ACCRA . FROM THECONGO WOULD COME THE EMBATTLED PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA . ALSO ON THELIST : NIGERIA'S ABLE PRIME MINISTER SIR ABUBAKAR TAFAWA BALEWA ;SENEGAL'S SENGHOR ; GUINEA'S SEKOU TOURE ; AND DOZENS MORE,INCLUDING, OF COURSE, THAT AFFABLE FELLOW FROM UP NORTH, EGYPT'S GAMALABDEL NASSER, WHO WAS AN AFRICAN OF A KIND .

OSAGYEFO WOULD BE PEDDLING HISPET SCHEME FOR A BICAMERAL ALL-AFRICA PARLIAMENT AND OTHER SIMILARQUICKIE APPROACHES TO A UNITED AFRICA . NO ONE WAS LIKELY TO BUYNKRUMAH'S SCHEMES, HOWEVER, FOR IT HAS LONG BEEN OBVIOUS TO ALL OFAFRICA THAT IT IS BASICALLY NKRUMAH THAT NKRUMAH WANTS TO PROMOTE .APART FROM THAT, REGIONAL DIFFERENCES MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE MOST THATCAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS A LOOSE ASSOCIATION OFAFRICAN COUNTRIES PATTERNED AFTER THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES,WITH A PERMANENT SECRETARIAT, COUNCIL AND PROGRAM FOR ECONOMICCOOPERATION . SUCH A GROUPING MIGHT HELP HEAL THE RIFTS AMONG THECONTINENT'S CURRENT RIVAL BLOCS CHIEF AMONG THEM THE LEFTLEANINGCASABLANCA GROUP (GHANA, GUINEA, MALI, MOROCCO, ALGERIA, EGYPT), ANDTHE MORE MODERATE MONROVIA GROUP, NOW COMPOSED OF NIGERIA, LIBERIA,SIERRA LEONE, ETHIOPIA, THE FORMER BELGIAN CONGO, AND MOST OF THEFORMER FRENCH DEPENDENCIES .
