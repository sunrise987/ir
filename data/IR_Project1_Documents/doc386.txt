CAMBODIA " BALANCE OF MENACES " A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A DARKBLUE SUIT STRODE INTO THE SPORTS STADIUM OF THE STEAMY CAMBODIANCAPITAL OF PNOMPENH (PRONOUNCED NOM-PEN) LAST WEEK, MOUNTED THEPLATFORM, AND BEGAN HARANGUING THE ASSEMBLED CROWD IN A WHINY,HIGH-PITCHED VOICE . THE SPEAKER WAS PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK,NEUTRALIST, MERCURIAL RULER OF CAMBODIA, AND HE HAD CALLED THE RALLY TOANNOUNCE IN EFFECT THAT THE U.S . WAS WORKING TO UNDERMINE HIS REGIME .TURNING THEATRICALLY TO THE THRONG, SIHANOUK ASKED WHETHER THE NATIONALHONOR DID NOT DEMAND THAT CAMBODIA REJECT ANY FUTURE HELP FROM THEAMERICANS . WHEN HIS SUBJECTS ROARED OBEDIENT APPROVAL, THE PRINCEORDERED : " SO BE IT . " SIHANOUK MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND AGAIN, AS HEHAS BEFORE . IN A FORMAL NOTE TO WASHINGTON, HE CALLED FOR A HALT TOALL AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID, WHICH IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARSHAS AMOUNTED TO $366 MILLION . AND SO THE U.S . ALREADY STRIVING TOSAVE WAR-TORN SOUTH VIET NAM AND " NEUTRAL " BUT TOTTERING LAOS FROMTHE REDS FACED ANOTHER MESS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . SHAKEN NEIGHBOR . WHATWAS AILING THE PRINCE ? A SUSPICIOUS, EMOTIONAL, FRENCH-EDUCATEDDESCENDANT OF CAMBODIA'S MEDIEVAL KHMER KINGS, HE ONCE PERFORMEDSLAPSTICK PARTS IN MOVIES (WHICH HE PRODUCED HIMSELF) AND HAS OFTENPLAYED SLAPSTICK POLITICS . FRIENDS SERIOUSLY REPORTED LAST WEEK THATTWO CONTRIBUTING REASONS FOR SIHANOUK'S BAD MOOD MIGHT BE THAT 1) HEHAD BEEN CRASH-DIETING TO LOSE 15 LBS . IN TEN DAYS, AND 2) THE U.S .TRANSFERRED A FORMER MILITARY ADVISORY CHIEF WITH WHOM THE PRINCEENJOYED PLAYING VOLLEYBALL . THE PRINCE HIMSELF ACCUSED THE U.S . OFSUPPORTING A CLANDESTINE RADIO, ON SOUTH VIET NAM SOIL, RUN BY THEPRINCE'S POLITICAL OPPOSITION (THE U.S . DENIED THE CHARGE) .BUT, ABOVE ALL, THEPRINCE TALKS OF THE " INEVITABILITY " OF COMMUNIST CHINA'S TAKEOVER OFSOUTHEAST ASIA, HENCE MAY BE TRYING TO SAVE HIMSELF BY COZYING UP TOTHE RED DRAGON . WHAT PRECIPITATED HIS LATEST PERFORMANCE COULD WELLHAVE BEEN THE OVERTHROW AND ASSASSINATION OF HIS LATE NEIGHBOR, SOUTHVIET NAM'S NGO DINH DIEM . ALTHOUGH SIHANOUK AND DIEM WERE BITTERENEMIES, THE PRINCE WAS SHAKEN BY DIEM'S DEATH AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO THECUTOFF OF DIEM'S AMERICAN AID . POSSIBLY DETERMINED NEVER TO GETHIMSELF ON THE SAME VULNERABLE SPOT, SIHANOUK MOVED QUICKLY TO LESSENHIS DEPENDENCE ON THE U.S . OPENING TO THE SEINE . FOR ALL HISECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR, SIHANOUK HAS ALSO SOMETIMES PROVED HIMSELF A SHREWDPOLITICIAN . SINCE INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE TEN YEARS AGO, HE HASJAILED HOME-GROWN COMMUNISTS AND WOOED HIS RED-HOT YOUNG LEFTISTCRITICS INTO THE GOVERNMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING WARMRELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND RED CHINA . SIHANOUK LAST WEEK PERFORMEDANOTHER TYPICALLY SLIPPERY GYRATION . INSTEAD OF RUSHING RIGHT INTOPEKING'S ARMS, HE TURNED TO HIS OLD COLONIAL TUTOR, FRANCE, AND ASKEDHER TO HELP REPLACE U.S . AID . SAID THE PRINCE : " FOR OUR COUNTRY,LIBERATED FROM THE U.S . AND WHICH THE COMMUNIST POWERS DO NOT WISH TOTAKE IN CHARGE, IT COULD BE THE HOUR OF FRANCE . " THE INVITATION WASANOTHER POTENTIAL OPENING FOR CHARLES DE GAULLE, WHO WANTS TO WHEEL ANDDEAL IN THE AREA OF FRANCE'S OLD INDO-CHINA EMPIRE (HE KEEPS SUGGESTINGA " NEUTRALIZED " VIET NAM, HINTED LAST WEEK THAT FRANCE MAY ESTABLISHDIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM) . BUT WHETHER PARISWILL FILL THE GAP TO BE LEFT BY THE ELIMINATION OF A $30 MILLION ANNUALU.S . DOLE REMAINS TO BE SEEN . FRANCE HAS BEEN SUPPLYING CAMBODIA ONLYONE TENTH THE U.S.'S CONTRIBUTION, MOSTLY TO MAINTAIN A 300-MAN FORCETRAINING THE CAMBODIAN ARMY .AT WEEK'S END THE PRINCECLIMAXED HIS PERPLEXING THEATRICS BY CALLING IN THE PRESS CORPS,DELIVERING A MEANDERING MONOLOGUE INTERSPERSED WITH GIGGLES . PROUDLY,HE ANNOUNCED THAT RED CHINA HAD OFFERED HIM MILITARY SUPPORT . " ITHINK I HAVE ACHIEVED A BALANCE OF MENACES, " HE SAID . " THE MENACE OFTHE IMPERIALISTS AND THEIR LACKEYS IS COUNTERBALANCED BY THE MENACE OFCOMMUNIST CHINA, OUR NO . 1 FRIEND . " BUT HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULDHAVE ONLY FOUR CHINESE CIVILIAN ADVISERS AND NO CHINESE MILITARYADVISERS : " EVERYWHERE IN OUR ARMY THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE POWERHELPING US FRANCE . " ADDED THE PRINCE : " I DO NOT LIKE TO BE ASATELLITE . I LIKE TO BE FREE . " SERVING CHAMPAGNE ALL AROUND, HEURGED THE CORRESPONDENTS TO DRINK UP BECAUSE (JOKINGLY REFERRING TOIMPENDING AUSTERITY) " IN A FEW MONTHS I WON'T BE ABLE TO OFFERCHAMPAGNE .
