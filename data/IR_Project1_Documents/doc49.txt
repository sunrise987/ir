CAMBODIA THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T BE KING ONCE HE DREAMED OFGOING TO HOLLYWOOD AS THE " CAMBODIAN CHARLIE CHAN . " THEN HE TOOK UPTHE SAXOPHONE AND MADE LIKE " CANNONBALL " ADDERLEY, BELTING OUT SUCHCOMPOSITIONS OF HIS OWN AS LOVE WITHOUT HOPE . HE SUPPORTED A TROUPE OF30 DANCING GIRLS AND A STRING OF 20 THOROUGHBREDS AND WORKED DILIGENTLYTO IMPROVE THE BREED . SPORTS ARE HIS LATEST CRAZE . HE CAPTAINS ACHAMPIONSHIP VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND RECENTLY DUNKED IN 92 POINTS IN ABASKETBALL GAME . ECCENTRIC AND MERCURIAL HE MAY BE, BUT CAMBODIA'SPRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK, 41, IS ALSO ONE OF THE SHREWDEST LEADERS INSOUTHEAST ASIA . SIHANOUK WAS CAMBODIA'S YOUNG KING UNTIL 1955, WHEN HESTEPPED DOWN FROM THE THRONE TO RUN FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE IN THEGOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THE " TRUE FACE OF THE PEOPLE WAS HIDDEN FROM ME ./ UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, CAMBODIA HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAMOF DEVELOPMENT . LAST YEAR THE RICE CROP WAS THE BEST IN MEMORY, AND ARECORD EXPORTABLE SURPLUS OF 400,000 TONS WAS PREDICTED . CAMBODIA DOESNOT HAVE ONE RIEL OF EXTERNAL DEBT, AND ITS CURRENCY IS 100 PER CENTCOVERED BY GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE (V . 50 PER CENT IN THE U.S.) ;25 PER CENT OF THE BUDGET IS SPENT ON EDUCATION, ONE OF THE HIGHESTPERCENTAGES IN THE WORLD . " SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . " BUT CAMBODIA, LIKEMANY PLEASANT AND LANGUID PLACES, IS NOW BESET BY PRESSING ECONOMICPROBLEMS . THE PLANNED $26 MILLION DEFICIT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR HASUNEXPECTEDLY DOUBLED, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SO SHORT OF CASH THAT THECURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN IS LITERALLY OUT OF MONEY . SOME $24 MILLIONWORTH OF PUBLIC PROJECTS HAVE HAD TO BE CANCELED, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGERESERVES ARE DWINDLING AT THE RATE OF $1,500,000 A MONTH . SIHANOUK'SREACTION WAS CHARACTERISTICALLY UNPREDICTABLE ; HE PURGED HISGOVERNMENT OF ITS OLDTIMERS AND INSTALLED IN THEIR PLACES A GROUP OFHIS MOST FIERY CRITICS . THEY ARE YOUTHFUL (AVERAGE AGE : 36),LEFT-WING, PARIS-TRAINED INTELLECTUALS WHOM SIHANOUK SNEERINGLY CALLS "THEIR SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . " SAYS SIHANOUK : " I KNOW THAT THEY DONOT LIKE ME . THEY HATE ME . THEY HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE COMMUNISTS. NOW I'VE GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SUPPORTING CAMBODIA FOR THEFIRST TIME . I TOLD THEM, " YOU CAN KILL ME, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TOKILL CAMBODIA . " ' WHAT'S GOOD FOR G . M . . . . BEHIND SIHANOUK'S ODDCHOICE OF MINISTERS IS AN ADROIT POLICY . WITH OPPONENTS IN HIS VERYCABINET, SIHANOUK IS ABLE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FOES, AND TO FORCE THEMTO SHARE BLAME FOR A WORSENING FINANCIAL SITUATION . HE HAS ALLOWED THECABINET TO SLASH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES, BUT VETOED ITS PROPOSAL TONATIONALIZE THE FRENCH RUBBER PLANTATIONS, WHICH ARE A PRIME SOURCE OFFOREIGN EXCHANGE . " THE FRENCH MIGHT BE CAPITALISTS, " SIHANOUK SAID,/ BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE . " HE ALSO DELIGHTS IN POINTING OUT TO HISLEFT-LEANING INTELLECTUALS THE FAILURE OF CAMBODIA'S RED CHINESE-BUILTFACTORIES . " THEY ONLY COST US MONEY, " SIHANOUK SAYS . " I TELL MYCABINET THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT FORD OR GENERAL MOTORS WOULD DO . " THOUGHHE DEALS ROUGHLY WITH CAMBODIA'S NATIVE COMMUNISTS, SIHANOUK ARTFULLYREFUSES TO JOIN EITHER THE COMMUNIST OR WESTERN CAMPS . HOPING TO KEEPHIM NEUTRAL, THE U.S . HAS WEIGHED IN WITH $300 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AIDSINCE 1955, TO THIS NATION OF 5,700,000 PEOPLE, AND RUSSIA HAS BUILT A500-BED HOSPITAL AND SENT INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT . CURRENTLY, NEUTRALISTSIHANOUK LEANS TOWARD MORE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN HIS COUNTRY, FOR HEFEELS THAT A COUNTERBALANCE IS NEEDED AGAINST THE RISING STRENGTH OFTHE COMMUNISTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . BUT THE MAIN OBJECT OF SIHANOUK'SPOLICY IS STILL TO " MAINTAIN THE JOIE DE VIVRE OF MY PEOPLE . I WANTTHEM TO WORK ALSO, BUT NOT SO HARD AS COMMUNISTS . WE CAMBODIANS ARENOT ANIMALS OR MACHINES . WE HAVE TO REMAIN GAY AND FREE . WE MUST BEALLOWED TO HAVE THE GOOD THINGS . /
