THE CONGO TEA & HARMONY IT WAS ALMOST AS WACKY AS THE MADHATTER'S OUTDOOR TEA PARTY IN WONDERLAND . SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF AMUDFOULED ROAD AT PUMPI, 40 MILES FROM SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE'SLAST-DITCH HEADQUARTERS AT KOLWEZI, UNITED NATIONS BRIGADIER REGINALDNORONHA SET UP FOUR FOLDING TABLES AND LAID OUT TEA, PEANUTBUTTERSANDWICHES, COFFEE AND SIMBA BEER . AT 9 A.M., RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, FOURKATANGA PROVINCE OFFICIALS AND THREE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNIONMINIERE MINING OUTFIT ROARED UP IN TWO AUTOS . " WE HAVE COME TO MEETYOU AS FRIENDS, " DECLARED ONE, AND THE PARTY WAS ON . DESPITE THEAPPARENT ABSURDITY OF IT, THE PUMPI TEA PARTY WAS A DEAD SERIOUS AFFAIRARRANGED SO THAT TSHOMBE COULD PEACEFULLY ESCORT UNITED NATIONS TROOPSINTO KOLWEZI, THE LAST MAJOR OBJECTIVE IN ITS DRIVE TO END KATANGA'S2F-YEAR SECESSION . TYPICALLY, TSHOMBE FAILED TO SHOW UP AT THE PARTY,BUT THE OPERATION WENT SMOOTHLY ANYWAY . WHEN THE SANDWICHES WEREMUNCHED AND THE TEA SIPPED, NORONHA LED A THREE-MILE COLUMN OF 1,000INDIAN TROOPS STRAIGHT INTO KOLWEZI . WHERE WERE THOSE PROUD KATANGESEDEFENDERS ? HUNDREDS OF GENDARMES HAD FLED INTO THE BUSH BEFORE THEBLUE-HELMETED U.N . TROOPS ARRIVED . SOME 75 WHITE MERCENARIES,INCLUDING A PISTOL-PACKING BLONDE AMBULANCE DRIVER KNOWN AROUND TOWN ASMADAME YVETTE, HAD TAKEN OFF FOR THE ANGOLAN BORDER . BUT MOST OFTSHOMBE'S 2,000 BEDRAGGLED MEN PAID HEED TO HIS PLEA TO " COOPERATEWITH THE U.N . AND OUR CONGOLESE BROTHERS, " DUTIFULLY STACKED THEIRARMS AT A NEARBY DEPOT . AT HIS YELLOW VILLA ON THE EDGE OF KOLWEZI,TSHOMBE GREETED NORONHA WITH A GRIN . " NOBODY SHOT AT YOU, I SEE, " HECRACKED . REPLIED NORONHA, THROWING AN ARM AROUND TSHOMBE'S SHOULDERS,/ I HAVE COME TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR WORD . " NORONHA WAS NOTTHE ONLY ONE WHO WAS RELIEVED THAT TSHOMBE WAS STICKING TO HIS PROMISETO REINTEGRATE KATANGA WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO . AT U.N .HEADQUARTERS IN MANHATTAN,SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT COULD NOW TURN TO APROBLEM THAT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN ENDING TSHOMBE'SSECESSION . IT WAS TO ESTABLISH THE CONGOLESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT'SAUTHORITY OVER ALL THE CONGO AND END THE ANARCHY THAT STILL REIGNS INMUCH OF THE NATION . AS A STARTER, THANT APPEALED FOR $19 MILLION TOFINANCE 1963 CIVILIAN OPERATIONS IN THE CONGO, ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST1,300 TECHNICAL EXPERTS WOULD BE NEEDED AT ONCE IN THE BIGGEST AIDPROGRAM THE U.N . HAS YET UNDERTAKEN . THE PLAN IS TO CUT THE U.N.'S19,000-MAN ARMY IN THE CONGO BY 50 PER CENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PERHAPSBY LATE SUMMER .
