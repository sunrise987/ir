SYRIA FOILED AGAIN GENERALLY SPEAKING, SYRIA'S SOLDIERS ARE NOGREAT SHAKES AT FIGHTING . BUT THEY'RE A PERSISTENT LOT WHEN IT COMESTO OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT AT HOME . NO FEWER THAN TEN ATTEMPTEDCOUPS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN 13 YEARS . ONE GROUP OF OFFICERS HAS PLOTTEDSTEADILY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS . LED BY COLONEL ABDEL KARIM NAHLAWI,39, THE MILITARY MALCONTENTS WERE IN ON THE COUP THAT SEVERED SYRIA'SUNION WITH EGYPT . LAST MARCH, THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT,BUT WERE PACKED OFF AS MILITARY ATTACHES IN SYRIAN EMBASSIES ABROAD .LAST WEEK THE OFFICERS WERE UP TO THEIR OLD TRICKS AGAIN . INCENSED BYA DAMASCUS DECREE STRIPPING THEM OF THEIR ARMY STATUS, THE GROUPARRANGED A DRAMATIC RENDEZVOUS IN TURKEY, THEN QUIETLY CROSSED THEFRONTIER AND MADE FOR THEIR OLD BARRACKS INSIDE SYRIA . GREETEDJOYOUSLY BY SOME OF THEIR FORMER COMRADES IN ARMS, NAHLAWI'S MEN ISSUEDA PUBLIC DEMAND THAT THEIR DISCHARGES BE CANCELED, AND THAT A NEWGENERAL STAFF TO THEIR LIKING BE PUT IN POWER . TO CONFUSE THINGS, THEREBELLIOUS SOLDIERS INSISTED ON A PLEBISCITE TO DECIDE ON CLOSERRELATIONS WITH NASSER'S EGYPT . OTHERWISE, NAHLAWI THREATENED, TROOPSUNDER HIS CONTROL WOULD MARCH ON DAMASCUS . FOR PRESIDENT NAZEMEL-KOUDSI, IT WAS AN OLD FAMILIAR TUNE . COOLLY, HE PLAYED FOR TIME,AGREED TO " CONSIDER " THE DEMANDS IF NAHLAWI WOULD NEGOTIATE AT ARMYHEADQUARTERS . THE TALKS DRAGGED ON FOR THREE CRISIS-FILLED DAYS .THEN, KOUDSI MOBILIZED HIS OWN FORCES, ONE NIGHT SUDDENLY SURROUNDEDTHE ARMY GHQ WITH ARMORED CARS . COLONEL NAHLAWI GOT THE POINT . INANOTHER COUNTRY, HE AND HIS MEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN JAILED, OR EVENEXECUTED FOR TREASON . BUT KOUDSI, WHO KEEPS A PREPARED RESIGNATION INHIS DESK JUST IN CASE THE SOLDIERS SHOULD SOME DAY WIN, CHOSE NOT TOPUSH HIS LUCK . ESCORTED ABOARD AN AIRLINER AND GIVEN $1,000 APIECE TOCOVER THEIR EXPENSES, THE REBELS WERE SENT BACK TO DIPLOMATIC POSTS INCIVVIES .
