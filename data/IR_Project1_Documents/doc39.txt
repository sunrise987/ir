GREAT BRITAIN AFTER HUGH, WHO ? THE DEATH OF HUGHGAITSKELL HAS LEFT BRITAIN'S OPPOSITION WITHOUT A SINGLE FIGURE WHO CANBE COUNTED ON TO UNITE THE LABOR PARTY BEHIND HIM . WORSE YET, WITHELECTION TALK IN THE AIR, LABORITES FEAR THAT NO LIKELY SUCCESSOR IS OFSUFFICIENT STATURE TO WIN IMMEDIATE NATIONAL ACCEPTANCE AS A POTENTIALPRIME MINISTER . THE PARTY IS TORN BETWEEN TWO LEADING CONTENDERS WHOPERSONIFY THE WARRING EXTREMES WITHIN THE PARTY THAT TOOK HUGHGAITSKELL SEVEN TURBULENT YEARS TO PACIFY . TOP RIGHT-WING CANDIDATE ISDEPUTY LEADER GEORGE BROWN, AN EARTHY, ONETIME ERRAND BOY WHOINFURIATES LEFTIST INTELLECTUALS BY ADDRESSING THEM AS " BROTHER . "BROWN, 48, IS A STAUNCH ANTI-COMMUNIST, A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE WESTERNALLIANCE, AND, UNTIL GAITSKELL COMMITTED THE PARTY TO AN ANTI-EUROPEANLINE, WAS A VIGOROUS ADVOCATE OF BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMONMARKET . GUTTY, IMPULSIVE, OFTEN EXPLOSIVELY GAUCHE, BROWN HAS HADLITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION OR TOP-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE, BUT ISA KNOWLEDGEABLE DEFENSE EXPERT WHO CRITICIZED BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TOTHE SKYBOLT MISSILE AS FAR BACK AS 1960 . HIS MOST IMPRESSIVEENDORSEMENT CAME LAST WEEK FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS ECONOMIST, WHICH ARGUEDTHAT CRITICISMS OF HIS QUICK TEMPER AND IMPATIENCE WITH TECHNICALDETAIL " COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN LEVIED AGAINST WINSTON CHURCHILL . "UNLIKE GAITSKELL, WHOSE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY WAS BASED ON ANESSENTIALLY OUT-OF-DATE VIEW OF AN " INSULAR AND DOWNTRODDEN ENGLAND, "ARGUED THE WEEKLY, BROWN'S SOCIALISM IS THAT " OF AN AGE WHENINTELLIGENT THRUSTERS HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK FORWARD IN OPPORTUNITY . " /LITTLE HAROLD . " LABOR'S LEFT WING SUPPORTS HAROLD WILSON, 46, ANADROIT, URBANE DEBATER AND TOPNOTCH INTELLECT WHO WAS AN OXFORDECONOMICS DON AT 21 . AS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE IN CLEMENTATTLEE'S CABINET, PIPE-PUFFING YORKSHIREMAN WILSON HAS HAD MOREADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE THAN ANY OF HIS RIVALS, IS THE PARTY'SFOREIGN POLICY SPECIALIST . DESPITE HIS BRILLIANCE AND CHARM, WILSON'SFOES, WHO CALL HIM " LITTLE HAROLD, " REGARD HIM AS A SLIPPERYOPPORTUNIST WHO BACKS ONLY WINNING CAUSES THOUGH HE MISCALCULATED IN1960 WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO GRAB THE LEADERSHIP WHILE GAITSKELL WASFIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE AGAINST THE PARTY'S POWERFUL ANTI-NATOBLOC . BROWN DEFEATED WILSON FOR THE DEPUTY LEADERSHIP, 133 TO 103,LAST YEAR . BUT THIS TIME BROWN HAS AN ADDED CHALLENGE : JAMESCALLAGHAN, 50, WHO ALSO HAS STRONG MIDDLE-ROAD AND RIGHT-WING SUPPORT .A NAVAL PETTY OFFICER'S SON WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER IN A GAITSKELL CABINET, " STOKER " CALLAGHAN IS A HARD-BOILEDDEBATER AND EFFECTIVE TV PERFORMER, BUT IS REGARDED BY MANY COLLEAGUESAS A LIGHTWEIGHT . TO PREPARE FOR THE CHANCELLORSHIP, HE HAS BEENCRAMMING WITH SOME OF OXFORD'S BRIGHTEST YOUNG DONS, WHO PRIVATELY RATEHIM " B OR B-PLUS . " HE IS AN ENGAGING, HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, ANDMANY OF BROWN'S SUPPORTERS FEAR THAT HE MAY SPLIT THE RIGHT-WING VOTE .IN A DEADLOCK, HE COULD EVEN EMERGE AS LABOR'S LEADER . FOE'S WOES .THE CHOICE OF AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION LEADER HAS SELDOM SEEMED MOREIMPORTANT TO THE LABOR PARTY OR TO THE NATION PARTICULARLY SINCEGOVERNMENTAL POWER IN BRITAIN HAS IN RECENT YEARS INCREASINGLY MOVEDFROM THE COMMONS AND THE CABINET INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRIME MINISTER .ADMITTEDLY, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LABOR PRIME MINISTER IN THE NEAR FUTUREHAS BEEN DIMMED BY GAITSKELL'S DEATH . ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TORIESHAVE LITTLE IMMEDIATE CAUSE FOR CONFIDENCE : ON TOP OF CHARLES DEGAULLE'S BRUSQUE REJECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BID FOR COMMON MARKETMEMBERSHIP, UNEMPLOYMENT THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE IN BRITISH POLITICSTODAY HAS JUMPED AN ALARMING 25 PER CENT IN ONE MONTH, REACHING A16-YEAR RECORD OF 814,632 (PARTLY DUE TO LAYOFFS IN THE BITTER WINTERWEATHER) . LABOR'S LEADER WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CHOSEN UNTILMID-FEBRUARY . LABORITES HOPED THAT TORY SETBACKS WOULD GIVE THEM TIMETO DEVELOP A WINNING PERSONALITY WHO COULD KEEP THEIR PARTY UNITED .
