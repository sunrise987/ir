COLD WAR THE SPIRIT OF MOSCOW AT TIMES IT WASALMOST MORE THAN WESTERN VETERANS OF MANY ANTICOMMUNIST BATTLES COULDBEAR . " LOVE, " SAID NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV IN MOSCOW, " LOVE AND RESPECTFOR OTHER PEOPLE IS WHAT WE NEED . " THE LOVE FEAST LASTED ALL WEEK .THE BEAMING SMILE SPLASHING ACROSS KHRUSHCHEV'S MOONFACE, THE BLUNT,BACK-SLAPPING PEASANT HUMOR, THE FRIENDLY-BEAR QUALITY OF THE SOVIETBOSS WHEN HE DECIDES TO BE AMIABLE ALL THESE FAMILIAR TRAITS WERE ONFULL DISPLAY IN MOSCOW AS U.S., BRITISH AND RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS SAT DOWNTO TRY TO NEGOTIATE A NUCLEAR TEST BAN AGREEMENT . WITH PAINFULMEMORIES OF THE SHORTLIVED " SPIRIT OF GENEVA " IN 1955 AND THEEVANESCENT " SPIRIT OF CAMP DAVID " IN 1959, U.S . OFFICIALS REFUSE TOREGARD KHRUSHCHEV'S JOVIALITY AS A TRUE BAROMETER OF EAST-WESTRELATIONS . YET FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE CONFERENCE TABLE, THEREWAS EVIDENCE THAT A NEW AND POSSIBLY SOMEWHAT MORE DURABLE SPIRIT OFMOSCOW WAS IN THE MAKING . DETECTABLE CHAIR . THE EASY MOOD PREVAILEDFROM THE MOMENT THE NEGOTIATORS ARRIVED . CHIEF U.S . NEGOTIATORAVERELL HARRIMAN BROUGHT WITH HIM THREE TONS OF TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT,FOR THE " HOT LINE " THAT IS TO LINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE KREMLIN INEMERGENCIES . AT THE FIRST MEETING, HARRIMAN, 71, WAS GREETED BYKHRUSHCHEV WITH A CHEERY " YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY BLOOMING . WHAT ARE YOUDOING, COUNTING YOUR YEARS BACKWARD ? " WHEN BRITAIN'S TOP ENVOY,VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SAID THAT MOSCOW'S WEATHER WAS BETTER THAN LONDON'S,KHRUSHCHEV REPLIED : " WE COULD PERHAPS FIND SOME PLACE FOR YOU HERE .YOU COULD BE AN INTERNEE . " FINALLY THE PRINCIPALS SAT DOWN AT THECONFERENCE TABLE, ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR TOP AIDES FOREIGN MINISTERANDREI GROMYKO, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER VALERIAN ZORIN, AND CHIEFDISARMAMENT NEGOTIATOR SEMYON TSARAPKIN ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE, U.S .AMBASSADOR FOY KOHLER AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR SIR HUMPHREY TREVELYAN FORTHE WEST . SAID KHRUSHCHEV : " WE BEGIN IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SIGNING ./ ADDED GROMYKO : " THEN ALL THAT WILL REMAIN WILL BE TO FILL THETREATY IN . " DURING THE EARLY SESSIONS, IT ALMOST SEEMED THAT EASY .KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT, SINCE IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH AGREEMENTON A FULL BAN IN THE PAST, THE TIME HAD COME TO ACHIEVE MORE BYATTEMPTING LESS . HE GAVE SOVIET APPROVAL TO A LIMITED BAN WHICH WOULDCOVER ALL TESTS EXCEPT THOSE UNDERGROUND, REPEATING HIS FAMILIAROPPOSITION TO ONSITE INSPECTIONS OF POSSIBLE UNDERGROUND BLASTS . ASUSUAL, GROMYKO ARGUED THAT SUCH INSPECTIONS WERE UNNECESSARY ANYWAY, INVIEW OF LONG-RANGE SEISMIC DETECTION DEVICES . WHEN THE SUDDEN CRASH OFAN ACCIDENTALLY OVERTURNED CHAIR STARTLED THE DELEGATES, GROMYKO SAIDQUICKLY : " THIS IS CONFIRMATION THAT EVERYONE DETECTS IT . " GROWLEDHAILSHAM : " IT STILL NEEDS INSPECTION . /SELLING MOOD .ARGUING THAT UNDERGROUNDBLASTS CAN INDEED BE DETECTED FROM FAR OFF BUT NOT DIFFERENTIATED FROMEARTHQUAKES, THE U.S . IS NEVERTHELESS WILLING TO DEFER THE QUESTION .AS FOR KHRUSHCHEV, HE WAS IN A SELLING MOOD . DRAWING OUT OF THE HAT AFIVE-YEAR-OLD SOVIET PROPOSAL, HE CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OFINSPECTION POSTS AT AIRFIELDS, HIGHWAYS, RAILROAD STATIONS AND PORTS ONBOTH SIDES OF THE IRON CURTAIN TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF SURPRISEATTACK . HE ALSO PROPOSED 1) FREEZING OR REDUCTION OF MILITARY BUDGETS,2) A REDUCTION OF THE ARMED FORCES ON BOTH SIDES IN EAST AND WESTGERMANY, AND 3) A NONAGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN THE NATO AND WARSAW PACTPOWERS . HE EVEN SEEMED WILLING TO ACCEPT THE U.S . IDEA OF PARALLELBUT SEPARATE DECLARATIONS INSTEAD OF A FORMAL PACT, WHICH WOULD AVOIDIMPLICIT U.S . RECOGNITION OF THE EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST REGIME . THESUDDEN ARRIVAL IN MOSCOW OF A HIGH-LEVEL EAST GERMAN DELEGATION THATINCLUDED WALTER ULBRICHT'S BERLIN SPECIALIST, IMMEDIATELY RAISEDSPECULATION THAT BERLIN WAS ON THE AGENDA . BUT ANY POSSIBLE DEALINVOLVING BERLIN OR THE BALANCE OF FORCES IN EUROPE WOULD REQUIRE U.S .CONSULTATION WITH ITS ALLIES . WEST GERMANY WASTED LITTLE TIME INWARNING THE U.S . THAT ANY AGREEMENT OTHER THAN A TEST BAN WOULD NOTONLY USHER IN A PERIOD OF " FALSE SECURITY " IN EUROPE, BUT WOULD ALSOMAKE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THE U.S.'S EUROPEAN ALLIES TO HEEDWASHINGTON'S PLEAS FOR HIGHER NATO MILITARY EXPENDITURES OR TO RESPECTTHE EMBARGO OF " STRATEGIC MATERIALS " TO THE EAST . NO OBSTACLES .WHY, AFTER YEARS OF STALLING, IS KHRUSHCHEV PUSHING A TEST BAN TREATYAND A DETENTE WITH THE WEST ? WESTERN DIPLOMATS POINT TO THESINO-SOVIET SPLIT AS THE MAIN REASON (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) ENGAGED INAN ALL-OUT POWER STRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE, KHRUSHCHEV PRESUMABLY WANTSA TEST BAN TREATY TO DEMONSTRATE TO COMMUNISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD THEFEASIBILITY OF " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE . " NOR WOULD KHRUSHCHEV MINDCUTTING DOWN A LITTLE ON THE PROHIBITIVE COST OF NUCLEAR TESTING ANDPRODUCTION, WHICH IMPEDES HIS OFT-STATED DESIRE TO RAISE LIVINGSTANDARDS IN THE SOVIET UNION . LASTLY, WHILE A TEST BAN WOULD NOT BEBINDING ON EITHER FRANCE OR RED CHINA, IT WOULD PLACE THE ONUS OFDEFYING THE AGREEMENT ON THEM . PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED AT HISPRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCORD, THE THREENEGOTIATORS GO TO GENEVA AND GET THE SIGNATURES OF THE 17-NATION GENEVADISARMAMENT CONFERENCE . SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BOX IN THE FRENCHWITH SOMETHING MORE THAN AN " ANGLO-SAXON " -SOVIET AGREEMENT FROM THEVIEWPOINT OF RUSSIA'S QUARREL WITH THE CHINESE, IT WOULD ALSO PUT SUCHGENEVA " NEUTRALS " AS EGYPT, BURMA AND INDIA ON THE RECORD ASSUPPORTING A SOVIET-SPONSORED AGREEMENT . AT WEEK'S END A TEST BANAGREEMENT SEEMED NEAR . BANTERING WITH HARRIMAN AT A RECEPTION,KHRUSHCHEV SAID : " THE TALKS ARE GOING ON WELL . THERE HAVE BEEN NOOBSTACLES . IF THEY GO ON AS THEY HAVE, AN AGREEMENT IS IN SIGHT . "
