SOUTH AFRICA A DAY AT THE STADIOM ONE OF THE FEW WAYS THAT SOUTHAFRICA'S HAPLESS BLACKS AND COLOREDS HAVE TO EXPRESS THEIR DISMAY ATAPARTHEID IT TO BOO VIGOROUSLY THE ALL-WHITE HOME TEAMS ATINTERNATIONAL SPORTS CONTESTS . IN 1955 THE UNPATRIOTIC FAVORITISM OFNONWHITES AT A RUGBY GAME WITH GREAT BRITAIN AT BLOEMFONTEIN BROUGHTABOUT A RACIAL SLUGFEST THAT RESULTED IN A TENYEAR BAN ON BLACK ANDCOLORED SPECTATORS IN THAT CITY ; FIVE YEARS AGO, A SIMILAR CLASHFORCED OFFICIALS TO HALT A SOUTH AFRICA-BRITAIN SOCCER MATCH INJOHANNESBURG'S RAND STADIUM . NONE OF THESE FEUDS MATCHED THE BATTLEFROM WHICH PORT ELIZABETH WAS RECOVERING LAST WEEK . THERE 50,000 WHITEFANS WERE ON HAND TO WATCH SOUTH AFRICA'S SPRINGBOKS FACE AUSTRALIA INTHE FINAL MATCH OF THIS YEAR'S RUGGER WORLD SERIES ; SOUTH AFRICA,WHICH HAS HELD THE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS, WAS BEHIND TWOGAMES TO ONE . THIS WAS QUITE ALL RIGHT WITH THE CROWD OF 5,000NONWHITES, WHICH INSIDE ITS SEGREGATED ENCLOSURE FELT NO SYMPATHY FORTHE LOCALS . WITH THE VISITORS AHEAD IN THIS FINAL MATCH, THE NONWHITESCHEERED SO LOUDLY THAT THE PUZZLED AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS WERE TAKEN ABACK. THEN, WITH 18 MINUTES TO PLAY, SOUTH AFRICA BOUNCED BACK TO TIE THESCORE AND THE BLACK BLEACHERS EXPLODED IN A ROAR OF ANGUISH . NONWHITESBEGAN POURING OVER THEIR FENCE ONTO THE FIELD, HURLING BOTTLES ANDBRICKS . POLICE WITH DRAWN CLUBS RUSHED THEM, JOINED BY VOLUNTEERWHITES . A WHITE FARMER EMPTIED HIS PISTOL INTO THE AIR . ON THE FIELD,SOUTH AFRICAN FORWARD DICK PUTTER WAS CUT IN THE MOUTH BY ONE MISSILE,AND AS A BOTTLE SPUN TOWARD REFEREE PIET MYBURGH, A HUSKY AUSTRALIANSAVED HIM WITH A FLYING TACKLE . AFTER PLAY RESUMED, SOUTH AFRICA WON,22 TO 6 . THE SCORE AMONG THE SPECTATORS : SIX WHITES AND 20 NONWHITESHOSPITALIZED, TWO NONWHITES ARRESTED, 40 CARS IN THE PARKING LOTDAMAGED FROM ROCKS RAINED ONTO THEM FROM THE BLACK STANDS . POSSIBLYHINTING THAT NONWHITES MAY BE BARRED FROM ALL STADIUMS, FOREIGNMINISTER ERIC LOUW THUNDERED THAT " ACTIVE MEASURES ARE NECESSARY TOPREVENT THIS SORT OF THING, " WHICH, HE COMPLAINED, " IS GIVING SOUTHAFRICA A BAD NAME OVERSEAS . " AS FOR PORT ELIZABETH, THE AUTHORITIESTHERE DECIDED THAT THE WISE COURSE WOULD BE TO SELL NO MORE BEVERAGESIN BOTTLES AND TO DOUBLE THE ADMISSION PRICE FOR NONWHITES AT FUTUREGAMES .
