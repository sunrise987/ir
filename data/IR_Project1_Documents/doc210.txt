SYRIA TO UNITY BY DISUNION IN CAIRO LAST WEEK, EGYPT'S NO . 2 MAN,FIELD MARSHAL ABDEL HAKIM AMER, STORMED AT A SYRIAN DELEGATION : " ISNASSERISM A CRIME IN SYRIA NOW ? IF IT IS, HOW CAN WE FACE THE FUTURETOGETHER ? IF THERE ARE IN DAMASCUS PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER NASSERISM ACRIME, THEN HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO COOPERATE WITH THEM ? " WHAT SETOFF AMER'S FLOOD OF RHETORICAL QUESTIONS WAS THE THREAT POSED TONASSER'S DREAM OF ARAB UNITY BY THE GYRATIONS OF SYRIA'S BAATH PARTYLEADERS, HEADED BY TALL, LUGUBRIOUS PREMIER SALAH BITAR . THE BAATHLEADERSHIP WANTS ARAB UNITY AS MUCH AS DOES NASSER, BUT IT HAS REFUSEDTO LET THE PARTY BE DROWNED IN AN ALLENCOMPASSING NASSERITE NATIONALFRONT . THE CONFLICT BECAME ACUTE LAST MONTH WHEN THE REGIME BEGANPURGING THE SYRIAN ARMY OF PRO-NASSER OFFICERS AND NONCOMS . INRETALIATION, SIX NASSERITE CABINET MINISTERS RESIGNED . WHILE STUDENTSSTAGED SITINS IN THE SCHOOLS, PRO-NASSER MOBS POURED INTO THE STREETSOF DAMASCUS AND ALEPPO, WHERE SCORES OF DEMONSTRATORS WERE KILLED ORWOUNDED BATTLING SOLDIERS AND POLICE . AS THE VIOLENCE IN THE STREETSGREW WORSE, THE BAATH LEADERS FACED THE PROSPECT OF DESTROYING ARABUNITY AND LOWERING THE PRESTIGE OF THEIR PARTY . LAST WEEK HARASSED,MOURNFUL PREMIER BITAR FINALLY GAVE IN AND RESIGNED TO BE REPLACED BY ACOMPROMISE CANDIDATE, DR . SAMI JUNDI, 40, A DENTIST FROM HAMA WHO WASPREVIOUSLY MINISTER OF GUIDANCE AND CULTURE . THERE WAS SOMEPOSSIBILITY THAT THE NEW PREMIER MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES :TO THE BAATHISTS BECAUSE JUNDI WAS ONCE A PARTY MEMBER AND HAD STOOD BYTHE GOVERNMENT ; TO THE NASSERITES BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN A LONGTIMEADMIRER OF EGYPT'S STRONGMAN AND BELIEVES IN UNITY AT ALL COSTS . ATWEEK'S END, THE REGIME IN NEIGHBORING IRAQ WAS ALSO GIVING GROUND TOTHE NASSERITES . THE ENTIRE BAATH-DOMINATED CABINET RESIGNED, BUT LEAN,BALDING PREMIER HASSAN BAKR WAS COMMISSIONED TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT,PRESUMABLY ONE WITH GREATER PRO-NASSER REPRESENTATION, WHICH MIGHTFORESTALL STREET DEMONSTRATIONS AND DISAFFECTION IN THE ARMY .
