RUSSIA    "WE TOO ARE PEOPLE"   NOT SINCE THE TROTSKYITE RIOTS IN THE1920'S HAD MOSCOW SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.  WHILE CROWDS OF RUSSIANSWATCHED WITH AMAZEMENT, MORE THAN 400 AFRICAN STUDENTS LASTWEEK BATTLED RED COPS IN THE STREETS, INSIDE RED SQUARE ITSELF,RIGHT PAST NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S OWN OFFICE WINDOW ."MOSCOW -- A SECOND ALABAMA," SAID ONE CRUDELY LETTERED SIGN,IN RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH . "STOP KILLING AFRICANS," WARNEDANOTHER PLACARD . MOURNING BANDS . THE RACE RIOT WASTOUCHED OFF BY THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF EDMOND ASARE-ADDO, 29,A SECOND-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT FROM GHANA WHO WASSTUDYING AT KALININ INSTITUTE, ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHWEST OF THECAPITAL . ON THE EVE OF HIS MARRIAGE TO A RUSSIAN GIRL, THE STUDENT'SBODY WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS OF A SUBURBAN MOSCOWSTATION . THE SOVIET POLICE CLAIMED THAT ASARE-ADDO, DRUNK, HADFALLEN DOWN IN THE 11 DEGREE-BELOW-ZERO WEATHER AND FROZEN TODEATH . BUT GHANAIANS, WHO KNEW THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS FIERCELY OPPOSEDBY THE GIRL'S RUSSIAN FRIENDS, INSISTED THAT THE YOUTH WAS STABBEDBELOW THE CHIN AND TOSSED INTO THE SNOW . QUICKLY SWINGING INTO ACTION,STUDENTS AT PATRICE LUMUMBA FRIENDSHIP UNIVERSITY SPREAD THE WORD TOOTHER AFRICANS IN LENINGRAD, KALININ, AND AS FAR AWAY AS ODESSA ANDTASHKENT . THE MESSAGE:  WE MARCH ON THE KREMLIN . WEARING THETRADITIONAL RED MOURNING BAND OF GHANA AROUND THEIR HEADS, THE STUDENTSGATHERED BEFORE THE GHANA EMBASSY ON A STREET A MILE FROM RED SQUARE ."NO TROUBLE," SHOUTED THEIR LEADERS AS THE PROCESSION TROOPED OFF, BUTAT THE END OF THE STREET, THERE WAS PLENTY . SOVIET POLICE HADBARRED THE WAY WITH TRUCKS AND CARS . WHEN THE COPS REFUSED TO BUDGE,THE CROWD BEGAN ROCKING A POLICE CAR, INTENDING TO FLIP IT OVER .ANXIOUS TO AVOID BLOODSHED, AND OUT-NUMBERED 100 TO 1, THE POLICE GAVEWAY AFTER A BRIEF SCUFFLE . AS ENGLISH-SPEAKING RUSSIANYOUTHS -- MEMBERS OF THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE -- BLOCKED THE VIEWFROM WESTERN PHOTOGRAPHERS, THE STUDENTS REGROUPED, MARCHEDTHROUGH THE HEART OF MOSCOW SINGING FREEDOM SONGS . BUT THE POLICEREGROUPED TOO, AND NEAR RED SQUARE, OFFICIALS COMMANDEERED MORETRUCKS TO BLOCK THE ENTRANCE . LOUDSPEAKERS BLARED "ENTRY TO RED SQUAREIS CLOSED," BUT THE AFRICANS SQUEEZED THROUGH A SPACE BETWEEN TWOTRUCKS; AS TWO STUDENTS DROPPED A POLICEMAN WITH A FLYING TACKLE,OTHER MARCHERS GRAPPLED WITH COPS ON TOP OF THE VEHICLES ."IT'S NATURAL ." ONCE AGAIN POLICE GAVE WAY . THE HORDE RACED ACROSSRED SQUARE, UP AN INCLINE NOT FAR FROM NIKITA'S WINDOW (HE WAS OUTINSPECTING AN ECONOMICS EXHIBITION), PAST LENIN'S GRANITE MAUSOLEUM, ANDON TOWARD THE HISTORIC SPASSKY GATE THAT LEADS TO THE INNER KREMLINGROUNDS . AT THAT MOMENT THE HUGE IRON GATES CLANGED SHUT . USINGSOUND TRUCKS, THE POLICE PLEADED WITH THE STUDENTS TO DISPERSE, BUT FORTWO MORE HOURS THEY ARGUED AND JOSTLED WITH POLICE . OGLING THEDEMONSTRATION WERE THOUSANDS OF RUSSIANS, WHO WATCHED FROM THE STREETAND FROM THE WINDOWS OF GUM, THE BIG STATE-OWNED DEPARTMENT STORE,UNTIL EMPLOYEES CURTAINED OFF THE UNCOMRADELY SCENE .FINALLY ABOUT 100 STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED TO INTERVIEW SOVIET MINISTER OFHIGHER EDUCATION VYACHESLAV ELIUTIN, WHO PROMISED AN INVESTIGATION OFTHE STUDENT'S DEATH . IT WAS A STORMY, TWO-HOUR SESSION, WITH AFRICANSDEMANDING AN END TO ALL FORMS OF OFFICIAL DISCRIMINATION . "AFRICANSTUDENTS GET BEATEN UP EVERY DAY," ONE PROTESTED . "AND SOVIETPOLICEMEN DO NOTHING ."NEITHER DID GHANA'S AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW J.B. ELLIOT . NEXT DAY, ASSTUDENTS AGAIN MASSED NEAR THE EMBASSY, HE CLOSED THE BUILDING (FOR"REPAIRS" TO DAMAGED FURNITURE), RAISED NO OBJECTION AS POLICE HERDEDTHE ANGRY GHANAIANS AWAY . ELLIOT TRIED TO LAUGH OFF THE MELEE,DISMISSED TALK OF WIDESPREAD BIAS AGAINST STUDENTS AS NOTHING BUT"RUMORS ." RELATIONS WITH SOVIET STUDENTS ARE CORDIAL, HE INSISTED ."BUT IT'S NATURAL TO TAKE A PUNCH AT EACH OTHER ."FUTILE PROTEST . EVEN KREMLIN PROPAGANDISTS DID NOT MAKE THATNONSENSICAL CLAIM . INSTEAD, THE RUSSIANS CLAMPED A TIGHT CENSORSHIPON THE EMBARRASSING AFFAIR, FOR TWO DAYS DID NOT PRINT OR BROADCAST ONEWORD ABOUT THE RIOT ALL MOSCOW WAS TALKING ABOUT . FINALLY,IZVESTIA ISSUED A STERN WARNING TO THE STUDENTS, TOLD THEM TO "RESPECTSOVIET LAWS" OR GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY . PRAGUE HAS ERUPTED IN TWORACE RIOTS WITHIN TWO YEARS . LAST FEBRUARY IN SOFIA, BULGARIANMILITIAMEN WIELDED CLUBS AGAINST 200 GHANAIANS WHO WERE MARCHING DOWNTHE MAIN STREET DEMANDING NOTHING MORE THAN THEIR OWN CAMPUSORGANIZATION . IN MOSCOW, AFRICANS HAVE BEEN SMOLDERING FOR YEARSOVER THINLY DISGUISED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION . EXCEPT FOR A TOKEN NUMBEROF RUSSIAN STUDENTS, THE DINING ROOMS AND DORMITORIES OF LUMUMBA U .(WHICH AFRICANS SARDONICALLY CALL "APARTHEID U .") ARE SEGREGATED .AFRICANS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DATE A RUSSIAN GIRL . STUDENTS SQUIRMAT THE STARES THEY GET IN PUBLIC AND OBJECT TO POOR SERVICE THEY OFTENRECEIVE IN RESTAURANTS . DESPITE PROFESSIONS OF BROTHERHOOD, MANYRUSSIANS STILL THINK AFRICANS ARE HALF-CIVILIZED STRANGERS WHO HAVEJUST EMERGED FROM THE JUNGLE . " WE TOO ARE PEOPLE, NOT ANIMALS," CRIEDONE SIGN CARRIED BY STUDENTS WHO SURGED THROUGH MOSCOW'S STREETS LASTWEEK . TO WHICH ONE RUSSIAN REPLIED, OBVIOUSLY GROANING UNDER THE WEIGHTOF THE IMPERIALIST WHITE MAN'S BURDEN:  "WE HELP THEM AND GIVE THEMAN EDUCATION . THEN THEY TURN AGAINST US ."
