SOUTH VIET NAM COPING WITH CAPRICORN IN BUSINESS, COUNT THECOSTS BEFORE YOU ACT . THE MOON NOW IN CAPRICORN SUGGESTS KEEPINGPRACTICAL VALUES IN MIND . TOMORROW IS RATHER TOO ENERGETIC FORCOMFORT, BUT THAT MAY BE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS ON THE MOVE . A LATEAUGUST HOROSCOPE SYNDICATED HOROSCOPES, MANY OF THEM FROM ABROAD, AREPOPULAR FEATURES IN MANY SOUTH VIETNAMESE NEWSPAPERS, BUT LAST WEEK THEGOVERNMENT BANNED THEM, PRESUMABLY ON THE THEORY THATSOME STAR-MINDED DISSIDENT MIGHT BE MOVED TO TRY A COUP ON ANASTROLOGICALLY AUSPICIOUS DAY . IN SOUTH VIET NAM EVERYBODY WAS INDEEDON THE MOVE, BUT WHERE THEY WERE MOVING WAS NO CLEARER THAN THE ZODIAC. THE U.S . WAS INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM(CAPRICORN), AND AFTER WHAT THE U.S . OFFICIALLY CALLED HIS " BRUTAL "CRACKDOWN ON THE BUDDHISTS, WASHINGTON OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT STRING ALONGWITH HIM AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED . SO THE U.S . MADE NOISES DESIGNEDTO ENCOURAGE OPPOSITION TO DIEM . BUT SOUTH VIET NAM BEING WHAT IT IS,POTENTIAL REBELS DID NOT WANT TO MOVE WITHOUT VIRTUALLY A WRITTENCONTRACT FOR U.S . SUPPORT . MEANWHILE THE U.S . TRIED TO PLACE THEODIUM OF THE CRACKDOWN ON DIEM'S BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU (LIBRA), ANDNEW AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE (CANCER) MANAGED TO SUGGEST, WITHOUTSAYING ANYTHING PUBLICLY, THAT HE DID NOT LIKE WHAT WAS GOING ON . THESIEGE . A WEEK AFTER THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN, SAIGON LOOKED LIKE ACITY UNDER SIEGE . HEAVILY ARMED SPECIAL FORCES UNITS GUARDED ALL KEYINSTALLATIONS . MOBILE " ANTI-SUICIDE ? ' SQUADSPATROLLED THE STREETS, READY TO DOUSE ANY FURTHER BUDDHIST ATTEMPTS ATSELF-IMMOLATION . AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY WAS ROLLED INTO POSITIONOUTSIDE SAIGON'S PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ; SINCE THE COMMUNIST VIET CONGHAVE NO PLANES, THE GOVERNMENT EVIDENTLY FEARED AN ATTACK FROM ITS OWNFORCE . HAVING JAILED MOST BUDDHIST LEADERS, THE REGIME MOVED TOSILENCE OTHER VOCAL OPPOSITION SAIGON'S SEETHING STUDENT POPULATION .IN THE CITY'S CROWDED MARKETPLACE AND NEAR SAIGON UNIVERSITY,RIFLE-TOTING COMBAT POLICE IN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS ARRESTED ALL YOUTHSOF HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AGE IN SIGHT ANDMME . NHU DOES NOT REVEAL THE DAY OR MONTHOF HER BIRTH, BUT THERE IS SPECULATION THAT SHE MAY BE ARIES ( " VERYIMPORTANT TOWIN THE TEST OF WILLS " ) OR LEO ( " IFCROSSED, ROARS LIKE A LION, LACKS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS IN THE MINDSOF OTHERS " ) . HAULED THEM OFF TO DETENTIONCAMPS ON THE OUTSKIRTS . THROUGHOUT THE CITY, BLUE-UNIFORMED MEMBERS OFNHU'S REPUBLICAN YOUTH ORGANIZATION MADE DOOR-TO-DOOR CALLS, WARNINGAGAINST PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ON PAIN OF ARREST . SCHOOLSWERE CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, AND SCHEDULED ELECTIONS FOR THENORMALLY RUBBER-STAMP, 123-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WERE POSTPONED .OVER RADIO SAIGON, THICH TINH KHIET, 80, HEAD OF THE GENERAL BUDDHISTASSOCIATION, PLEDGED HIS LOYALTY TO THE GOVERNMENT, BUT A NEWSPAPERPICTURE CLEARED BY INATTENTIVE CENSORS SHOWED THE AGED MONK WITH ABLACK EYE AND BRUISES ALL OVER HIS FACE . THE GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED THATHE HAD FALLEN DOWN . IN OTHER RESPECTS, CENSORSHIP WAS STRINGENT . INOUTGOING CABLES FROM NEWSMEN, THE WORD CATHOLIC WAS BLUE-PENCILED ;AFTER PASSING THE CENSORS, ONE STORY REFERRED TO " ROMAN PRESIDENT NGODINH DIEM . " THE GENERALS . AT WEEK'S END MARTIAL LAW WAS GRADUALLYEASED, AND SOME BUDDHISTS AND STUDENTS WERE FREED . THERE WAS LITTLEDOUBT THAT NHU WAS IN LARGE MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING THINGS, BUTTHERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS SUPPLANTING HIS BROTHER ; AS FAR ASCOULD BE DETECTED, THE TWO WERE WORKING IN HARMONY . DIRECTLY UNDERNHU, TWO OFFICERS SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND : BESPECTACLED, POCKMARKEDCOLONEL LE QUANG TUNG, IN CHARGE OF THE SPECIAL FORCES, AND BRIGADIERGENERAL TON THAT DINH, COMMANDER OF THE III ARMYCORPS AND MILITARY GOVERNOR OF SAIGON, A DAPPER GRADUATE OF THE U.S .COMMAND AND GENERAL STAFF SCHOOL AT FORT LEAVENWORTH, WHO WEARS A REDBERET, CARRIES A SWAGGER STICK, AND LIKES TO BE ACCOMPANIED ON MILITARYOPERATIONS BY HIS OWN PHOTOGRAPHER . OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S 17 GENERALS,DINH IS ONE OF TWO WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TROOPS AT THEIR DISPOSAL ; THEOTHER, BRIGADIER GENERAL NGUYEN KHANH, IS LOCATED IN A FIGHTING AREAHUNDREDS OF MILES NORTH OF SAIGON . MOST OF THE OTHER GENERALS HAVEBEEN DEPRIVED OF REAL POWER BY DIEM AND NHU, AND HAVEBEEN BROUGHT TO SAIGON WHERE THEY CAN BE WATCHED . AT A TIME WHEN THEARMY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN THE SOUTH VIET NAM SITUATION, THESEOFFICERS ARE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED IN WASHINGTON . AMONG THEM : MAJORGENERAL TRAN VAN DON, CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND TECHNICALLY INCHARGE OF ADMINISTERING THE COUNTRY UNDER MARTIAL LAW . ACTUALLY HECOMMANDS ONLY A BODYGUARD OF 50 TROOPS, AND AT THE MOMENT IS CONSIDEREDA FIGUREHEAD . BRIGADIER GENERAL TRAN TU OAI, AN ARTICULATE OFFICERWHOM NHU SIDETRACKED INTO THE POST OF DIRECTOR OF THE MALARIAERADICATION PROGRAM . " I'M THE ONLY GENERAL IN THE ARMY, " SAID TRAN,/ WHO IS ARMED WITH A SPRAY GUN . " HE IS NOW CHIEF OF PSYCHOLOGICALWARFARE . MAJOR GENERAL DUONG VAN MINH, A TOUGH, HUSKY TYPE WHOSE MOUTHIS FILLED WITH GOLD-CAPPED BROKEN TEETH AND WHO IS REGARDED AS ONE OFTHE BEST OFFICERS IN SOUTH VIET NAM . HE IS KNOWN AS " BIG " MINH, TODISTINGUISH HIM FROM BRIGADIER GENERAL TRAN VAN MINH, OR " LITTLE "MINH, NO KIN . HE HAS NO COMMAND AT PRESENT, BUTSERVES AS DIEM'S " MILITARY ASSISTANT . " BRIGADIER GENERAL PHAM XUANCHIEN, ONETIME DIRECTOR OF SECURITY SERVICES, WHO WAS SACKED BY NHUWHEN HIS AMBITIONS BEGAN TO GET OUT OF HAND . HE NOW HAS THE VIRTUALLYMEANINGLESS JOB OF ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF . DETERMINED TO DISSOCIATEITSELF FROM DIEM'S ANTI-BUDDHIST POLICIES AND TO KEEP THE ARMY ON ITSSIDE THE U.S . FORMALLY ABSOLVED SOUTH VIET NAM'S MILITARY LEADERS OFRESPONSIBILITY IN NHU'S SACKING OF THE BUDDHIST TEMPLES . IN ANUNUSUALLY SHARP STATEMENT, WASHINGTON SAID THAT THE GENERALS WERE " NOTAWARE OF THE PLANS TO ATTACK THE PAGODAS, MUCH LESS THE BRUTAL MANNERIN WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED OUT . " SAIGON BITTERLY DENIED THEWASHINGTON STATEMENT PRODUCED A DOCUMENT SIGNED BY ARMY LEADERS TO THEEFFECT THAT THEY HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE ACTIONIT DID . " TOP U.S . INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS COUNTERED THAT ARMYLEADERS HAD BEEN COERCED INTO SIGNING THE DOCUMENT . THE ALTERNATIVE .IN A COUNTRY WHERE INTRIGUE AND DOUBLE-DEALING ARE ENDEMIC, THE ARMYOFFICERS ARE FAR FROM UNITED . BUT ONE TOP VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL SECRETLYIN CONTACT WITH ARMY DISSIDENTS MAINTAINS THAT A COUP CAN AND WILL BESTAGED, THAT BOTH THE MARINES AND THE AIR FORCE WOULD JOIN IN ANYUPRISING, AND THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH DISAFFECTED ARMY UNITS IN SAIGONITSELF TO NEUTRALIZE TUNG'S SPECIAL FORCES . AT WEEK'S END THERE WEREMUFFLED REPORTS THAT, MEETING IN TWOS AND THREES, OFFICERS HAD AGREEDON A LEADER WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO KEEP DIEM AS TITULAR HEAD OF STATEIF NHU, HIS WIFE, AND BROTHER THUC, ARCHBISHOP OF HUE, WERE ELIMINATED. NO MATTER HOW REAL THE OPPOSITION TO DIEM, THE DISSIDENTS AREOBVIOUSLY AFRAID THAT THE U.S . MIGHT NOT FULLY BACK THEM IN A COUP .AS A FIRST SIGN OF U.S . SUPPORT, THEY WANT WASHINGTON TO ANNOUNCECESSATION OF AID TO THE DIEM REGIME . THIS THE U.S . IS NOT PREPARED TODO BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY SLASH WHATEVER INFLUENCE THE U.S . HAS INSOUTH VIET NAM . BESIDES, THE U.S . BELIEVES THAT THE DIEM REGIME CANKEEP GOING FOR PERHAPS A YEAR EVEN WITHOUT U.S . AID . IF THEOPPOSITION SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S . CANNOT BE COUNTED ON, THEU.S . RECIPROCATES THE FEELING . AS OF LAST WEEK, AT LEAST ONE MAJORPOLICYMAKER IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT FELT THAT THE SOLUTION WAS NOT TOTRY TO FORCE OUT DIEM BUT TO FORCE HIM INTO MORE ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIORPOSSIBLY CURBING BROTHER NHU AND TAKING OTHER MEASURES TO REDEEMHIMSELF WITH THE BUDDHISTS . CRITICS OF THIS POLICY POINT OUT THAT "CONTROLLING " DIEM HAS BEEN A U.S . AIM FOR YEARS, AND THAT NO ONE HASYET MANAGED TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY ; THEY ALSO BELIEVE THAT DIEM WILLNEVER REALLY BREAK WITH NHU OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY . INTHEIR VIEW, DIEM IS NOW HOPELESSLY DISCREDITED, AND THEY URGE ADIFFERENT CIVILIAN RULER POSSIBLY VICE PRESIDENT NGUYEN NGOE THO, WHOHAS OPENLY DISAGREED WITH DIEM BACKED BY SOME EFFICIENT OFFICERS . JUSTHOW THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IS ANOTHER QUESTION . THE WAR . AS IF THESITUATION IN SAIGON WERE NOT COMPLICATED ENOUGH, FRANCE'S CHARLES DEGAULLE CHOSE TO ENTER IT WITH AN ORACULAR STATEMENT THAT FRANCESYMPATHIZED WITH " THE TRIBULATIONS OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, " ANDPLEDGED " CORDIAL COOPERATION " WITH " ALL VIET NAM " IN ROOTING OUT "FOREIGN INFLUENCE . " HE CONVENIENTLY OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT, HAD ITNOT BEEN FOR FRANCE'S OWN DISASTROUS DEFEAT IN ITS NINE-YEAR VIETNAMESEWAR, THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE IN ITS PRESENT MESS . APART FROMDELIBERATELY ANTAGONIZING THE U.S . AT A MOMENT WHEN IT WAS CAUGHT INAN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION, DE GAULLE SOUNDED AS IF HE WERETRYING TO ENCOURAGE A UNITED VIET NAM, WITH NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHERAGAIN BUT NEUTRALIZED . THE IDEA SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTED BY NONE OTHERTHAN NORTH VIET NAM'S HO CHI MINH, WHO LAST WEEK GLOWINGLY PREDICTEDDIEM'S FALL, BUT HINTED THAT HE MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY A NEUTRALIZED,LAOS-TYPE GOVERNMENT . BY CONTRAST, CHINA'S MAO TSE-TUNG, WHO ALSOCOMMENTED ON THE SOUTH VIET NAM SITUATION, SEEMED TO OPPOSENEUTRALIZATION, AND PREDICTED THAT DIEM WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY JUSTANOTHER " U.S . LACKEY . " IN SAIGON, AMBASSADOR LODGE, THOUGH PLAINLYPLAYING FOR TIME, TOOK HOLD FIRMLY . IN TALKS WITH BOTH DIEM AND NHU(THE LATTER DESCRIBED AS " HOSTILE " BY INSIDERS), LODGE EXPRESSED THEU.S.'S SHARP DISAPPROVAL OF THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICIES . POINTEDLY HEREJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMAND THAT THE U.S . TURN OVER TWO BUDDHISTMONKS WHO WERE GIVEN SANCTUARY IN THE U.S . AID MISSION BUILDING .LODGE'S DETERMINATION NOT TO BE BUFFALOED IMPRESSED TOP EMBASSY AIDES ./ I'M RUNNING THINGS HERE, AND I INTEND TO RUN THEM WITH A FIRM HAND, "HE TOLD STAFFERS . " IF WASHINGTON WANTS A WEASEL FOR THIS JOB, IT CANFIND SOMEONE ELSE . " LODGE'S FIRST TASK IS TO SEE THAT THE POLITICALMANEUVERING DOES NOT AFFECT THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR AGAINST THECOMMUNISTVIET CONG . AT LEAST ONE TROOP UNIT HAS BEEN MOVED FROM A FIGHTING ZONEINTO THE CAPITAL, AND OFFENSIVE MILITARY MISSIONS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHATDIMINISHED . BUT SO FAR, THE WAR AGAINST THE REDS HASN'T BEENRADICALLY HURT BY EVENTS IN SAIGON .
