FROM MOST OF THEM, MALI ACCEPTS ASSISTANCE . " ONE DOESNOT TELL A MAN WHO IS DROWNING TO CHOOSE THE BRANCH OR THE PLANK HEWILL CATCH HOLD OF, " MALI'S TOWERING (6 FT . 4 IN.) PRESIDENT MODIBOKEITA EXPLAINS . SINCE MALI'S 1960 BREAKAWAY FROM FRANCE AND THERUPTURE OF ITS SHORT-LIVED FEDERATION WITH SENEGAL, KEITA HAS BEENREACHING FOR HELP IN A FASHION THAT FEW DARK CONTINENT LEADERS MANAGETO DUPLICATE . TODAY MALI RECEIVES AID FROM NO FEWER THAN 13 NATIONS ONBOTH SIDES OF THE IRON CURTAIN . TRUCKS & PADDIES . TO MALI'S BACKWATERCAPITAL OF BAMAKO, THE U.S . ANTED UP $2,500,000 A YEAR .

ACERTAIN INDECISION . FOR ALL ITS COOKS, IMPOVERISHED MALI IS BREWINGPRECIOUS LITTLE PROGRESS . THE CHIEF REASON IS THAT, WHILE TALKINGNEUTRALISM ABROAD, AT HOME KEITA AND HIS UNION SOUDANAISE PARTY RUN ASLOPPY LITTLE MARXIST-STYLE LAND THAT IS DEEP IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE . INLINE WITH HIS GOAL OF " AN ECONOMY BASED ON SOCIALIST PRINCIPLES, "KEITA HAS BUILT UP ONE MONEY-DEVOURING STATE ENTERPRISE AFTER ANOTHER .THERE IS THE AIRLINE, NOW IN DEBT TO THE TUNE OF $3,000,000 ; THERE ISTHE STATE TRADING COMPANY, CURRENTLY IN THE RED $3,200,000 ; AND, OFCOURSE, A CHAIN OF SUBSIDIZED " PEOPLE'S SHOPS . " SIX MONTHS AGO,EGGED ON BY THE COMMUNISTS, KEITA SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT A PROUD NEW MALIFRANC TO REPLACE THE FRENCH AFRICAN FRANC IT HAD BEEN USING . OWING TOMALI'S NEAR BANKRUPTCY, IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY NONCONVERTIBLE . SINCE FEWFOREIGNERS WOULD ACCEPT IT, THE MONEY (PRINTED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA)PROMPTLY WIPED OUT 85 PER CENT OF NORMAL IMPORTS, WHOSE DUTIES HADPROVIDED THE BULK OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE . DEPRIVED OF THEIR GOODS, MALIMERCHANTS WENT ON A RIOTING RAMPAGE IN BAMAKO AND SACKED THE POLICESTATION ; TWO DEMONSTRATORS WERE KILLED, AND A " PEOPLE'S TRIBUNAL "IN BAMAKO SENTENCED 77 OTHERS TO PRISON AT HARD LABOR .

IN PARIS THE FRENCHLISTENED WITH ALMOST SAINTLY PATIENCE TO MALI'S PLEAS FOR A MASSIVEBAIL-OUT LOAN ; WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE, FRANCE IS EXPECTED TO COMEACROSS WITH THE CASH . AS AN EXPORTER OF PEANUTS AND BEEF (ITS CATTLEARE NORTH OF AFRICA'S TSETSE FLY ZONE), SELF-SUFFICIENT IN RICE ANDOTHER STAPLES, MALI JUST MIGHT MAKE THE GRADE, DESPITE THE MARXISTTRAPPINGS . IN ANY CASE, MODIBO KEITA, LIKE MANY ANOTHER AFRICANLEADER, IS STILL OPEN TO SUGGESTION ON WHICH IDEOLOGY IS BEST .
