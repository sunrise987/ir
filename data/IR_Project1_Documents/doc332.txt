NORWAY END OF ANINSTITUTION INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE NAZI OCCUPATION, NORWAY'S LABORPARTY HAD BEEN IN POWER FOR 28 YEARS, LONGER THAN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATICPARTY IN EUROPE . LAST WEEK IT WAS OUT . AT THE ROOT OF ITS DOWNFALLWAS A LONG-DEVELOPING SCHISM BETWEEN THE PARTY'S MODERATE, PRO-WESTMAJORITY AND ITS FAR-LEFT FRINGE, WHICH DEMANDS NORWAY'S WITHDRAWALFROM NATO.TWO YEARS AGO, SOME LEFTIST LABORITES BOLTED, FORMED ASPLINTER " SOCIALIST PEOPLE'S PARTY, " AND MANAGED TO WIN TWOPARLIAMENTARY SEATS ON THE 1961 ELECTION . PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THEDEFECTION, PREMIER EINAR GERHARDSEN'S GOVERNMENT LOST ITS MAJORITY INTHE STORTING (PARLIAMENT), FOUND ITSELF DEADLOCKED, 74 SEATS TO 74SEATS, WITH THE OPPOSITION COALITION . THE BALANCE OF POWER WAS HELD BYTWO SPLINTER LEFTISTS . RELUCTANTLY, GERHARDSEN ACCEPTED THEIR SUPPORTTO STAY IN OFFICE . WHAT BROKE UP THE UNEASY COALITION AND BROUGHT ONNORWAY'S FIRST GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN A GENERATION WAS A TRAGIC SCANDALIN THE STATE-RUN COAL MINES . IN RECENT YEARS, FOUR DISASTROUSEXPLOSIONS AND SEVERAL LESSER ACCIDENTS HAVE PLAGUED THE MINES, AT ACOST OF 74 LIVES . SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, AN INVESTIGATING COMMISSIONCHARGED OFFICIAL NEGLIGENCE . LAST WEEK, AFTER FOUR DAYS OF ANGRYDEBATE, THE TWO SPLINTER SOCIALISTS JOINED WITH THE OPPOSITION IN ANO-CONFIDENCE VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . ONE OF THE LEFTISTS, FINNGUSTAVSEN, EXPLAINED THAT THE S.P.P . TOPPLED GERHARDSEN BECAUSE " HEHAS NO LONGER ANY CONTACT WITH THE WORKING CLASS . " THERE WAS SPITEINVOLVED, TOO ; GERHARDSEN RECENTLY APPOINTED THAT OLD COMMUNISTTARGET, EX-U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL TRYGVE LIE, A STAUNCH LABORITE, TOTHE POST OF MINISTER OF INDUSTRY . AS THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER OF HISPARTY FOR TWO DECADES, GERHARDSEN, 66, HAD BECOME A NATIONALINSTITUTION, WAS SO SCRUPULOUS THAT HE INSISTED ON BUYING HIS OWNPOSTAGE STAMPS FOR PERSONAL LETTERS . HE RAN A PART-FREE, LARGELYCONTROLLED ECONOMY, WAS STAUNCHLY PRO-WEST AND LED NORWAY INTO NATO .HIS SUCCESSOR WAS EXPECTED TO BE BLOND, HUSKY CONSERVATIVE FLOOR LEADERJOHN LYNG, 58, ATTORNEY AND BRILLIANT PROSECUTOR OF NORWAY'S NAZI WARCRIMINALS . CONSERVATIVE LYNG'S FOUR-PARTY COALITION CONSISTS CHIEFLYOF FARMERS, MERCHANTS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, WHOSE ECONOMIC VIEWS ARE LESSSTATIST THAN THE LABORITES' ; BUT LYNG WILL HARDLY TRY TO ALTERNORWAY'S DEEPLY INGRAINED WELFARE SOCIETY AND CERTAINLY NOT ITS NATOPOLICIES . WITH THE TWO MAVERICK LEFTISTS STILL HOLDING THE BALANCE OFPOWER, HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL BE LUCKY TO SURVIVE UNTIL THE NEXTELECTION IN 1965 .
