DIEM WAS INFAVOR OF THE IDEA . BUT HE ALWAYS REPLIED THAT AS ABRAHAM LINCOLNWAITED TWO YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR BEFORE ISSUINGHIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, HE, TOO, WOULD WAIT FOR A PROPITIOUSMOMENT SO THAT THE MOVE COULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS A DESPERATE GESTUREBY A SINKING GOVERNMENT TO ROUND UP POPULAR SUPPORT .
