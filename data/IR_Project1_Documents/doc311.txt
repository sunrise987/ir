GREAT BRITAIN THE SAGA OF POLISH PETER LIKE THE OVERTURNING OF ADEEPLY EMBEDDED ROCK, THE PROFUMO SCANDAL CAUSED A FRANTIC SCURRYING OFA GREAT MANY ODD HUMAN INSECTS . ONE OF THE CRAWLIEST FIGURES TO EMERGEWAS THAT OF PETER RACHMAN, WHO MAY, OR MAY NOT, BE DEAD . LAST WEEKPRESS AND PARLIAMENT WERE ABUZZ WITH HIS SORDID STORY . RACHMAN LOOKEDTHE PART OF AN IAN FLEMING VILLAIN . SHORT AND FAT, WITH GROTESQUELYTINY HANDS AND FEET, HE HAD NO NECK, A BALD HEAD SHAPED LIKE A SOCCERBALL, AND SUNKEN BLUE EYES ALWAYS HIDDEN BEHIND DARK GLASSES . HEDRESSED FLASHILY, WORE ELEVATOR SHOES OF CROCODILE LEATHER . IT AMUSEDHIM TO WATCH NAKED LADY WRESTLERS, AND HE HAD A FETISH ABOUT HYGIENE,INSISTING THAT ALL HIS SILVERWARE BE STERILIZED AND UNTOUCHED BY HUMANHANDS . MORE THAN MOST MEN, RACHMAN LOVED MONEY AND WOMEN . WHITE CHIEF. IN 1946, WHEN HE WAS 26, POLISH-BORN RACHMAN HAD ARRIVED IN BRITAINVIRTUALLY PENNILESS AND POSSESSING A STATELESS PERSON'S PASSPORT . ATFIRST, HE FOUND POSTWAR BRITAIN A BLEAK PLACE . HIS ENGLISH WAS POOR,AND HE LABORED AS KITCHEN HELPER, INSURANCE AGENT AND BLACK MARKETEER .HE MADE HIS BID FOR FORTUNE IN THE EARLY 1950S BY BORROWING $2,500 TOBUY A LODGING HOUSE NEAR LONDON'S HARROW ROAD . THE HOUSE COST SOLITTLE BECAUSE SEVEN OF ITS EIGHT ROOMS WERE OCCUPIED BY TENANTSPROTECTED BY RENT CONTROL AND IMMUNE FROM EVICTION . RACHMAN RENTED THEONE EMPTY ROOM TO A PARTY OF EIGHT WEST INDIAN MUSICIANS WHO WEREENCOURAGED TO HOLD NIGHTLONG PARTIES AND RAISE HELL ; THEY DID, TOSUCH GOOD EFFECT THAT THE SEVEN WHITE TENANTS MOVED OUT WITHIN THREEMONTHS AND WERE REPLACED BY SWARMS OF WEST INDIANS PAYING VASTLYINFLATED RENTS . EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER, RACHMAN SOLD THE HOUSE FOR FIVETIMES WHAT HE HAD PAID FOR IT, AND MOVED ON TO FURTHER REAL ESTATETRIUMPHS IN THE RUNDOWN AREAS OF PADDINGTON, BAYSWATER AND NOTTING HILL. IN HIS SINGLE-MINDED EFFORT TO GET LOWRENT TENANTS OUT OF HIS HOUSESAND HIGHRENT TENANTS IN, RACHMAN HIRED MEN TO URINATE IN HALLWAYS,SMASH FURNITURE, AND ONCE IN BAYSWATER TO REMOVE THE ROOF OF A HOUSEAND ABANDON THE STUBBORN TENANTS TO THE MERCY OF WIND AND WEATHER . INTHE UNDERWORLD HE GOT THE NAME OF " POLISH PETER, " AND WEST INDIANS,WHO KNEW HIS POWER, CALLED HIM " WHITE CHIEF RACHMAN MAN . " BENTBASEMENT . THE RENT ACT OF 1957 VIRTUALLY LIFTED ALL CONTROLS ANDENABLED RACHMAN TO SHOEHORN TENANTS INTO HIS FLATS AT WHATEVER PRICESTHE TRAFFIC WOULD BEAR . HE ALSO SHOWED TALENT FOR " BENDING THEBASEMENT, " THAT IS, CONVERTING CELLAR SPACE INTO CRIBS FOR PROSTITUTESOR INTO NIGHTCLUBS THE 1959 STREET OFFENCES ACT, WHICH DROVEPROSTITUTES OFF LONDON PAVEMENTS, BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER WINDFALL, FOR THEGIRLS WOULD PAY MORE FOR ROOMS THAN EVEN THE DESPERATE WEST INDIANS .IN ONE HOUSE, SEVEN PROSTITUTES WERE CHARGED $10 PER DAY, PAYABLE EVERYDAY AT NOON, OR $25,000 ANNUALLY, FOR A HOUSE VALUED AT $4,200 .THE SAGA OF POLISHPETER     RACHMAN WAS NEVER ONCE FOUND GUILTY OF AN ILLEGAL ACT, ANDNEVER ONCE PAID A PERSONAL INCOME TAX . POLICE AND PUBLIC HEALTHOFFICERS NEARLY LOST THEIR MINDS TRYING TO TRACE THE TRUE OWNERSHIP OFHIS 400 TO 500 BUILDINGS . THEY WOULD DISCOVER THAT IN A SINGLE RACHMANHOUSE DIFFERENT OWNERS WERE LISTED FOR DIFFERENT FLOORS ; ONE COMPANYWOULD HAVE A LEASE TO COLLECT RENTS, ANOTHER TO MAKE REPAIRS, AND ATHIRD WOULD SIMPLY BE HOLDING THE HOUSE " IN TRUST " FOR ONE OFRACHMAN'S MYRIAD FIRMS . BY 1959, RACHMAN HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO STARTDEALING IN BETTER-CLASS APARTMENTS, HOTELS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS . HEMARRIED AUDREY O'DONNELL, A PRETTY LANCASHIRE GIRL WHO HAD SERVED AS ANOFFICER IN HIS MULTIPLE CORPORATIONS, AND MOVED INTO A MOCK-GEORGIANMANSION JUST OFF HAMPSTEAD HEATH'S MILLIONAIRES' ROW . THE GARAGE WASLARGE ENOUGH TO HOUSE THEIR SIX CARS . NUMBERS FAME . ALWAYS ON THELOOKOUT FOR GIRLS FOR HIS PERSONAL USE, RACHMAN FREQUENTLY VISITED THESEVERAL NIGHTCLUBS HE OWNED, AND WOULD SIT IN A CORNER LIKE A SATANICKEWPIE, A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH, DIAMONDS ON HIS PUDGY FINGERS, A BLONDEJUVENILE OBEDIENTLY AT HIS SIDE, AND A BODYGUARD IN THE BACKGROUND .CHRISTINE KEELER WAS ONE OF HIS MANY MISTRESSES, AND IN OCTOBER 1960,HE SET UP MANDY RICE-DAVIES, CHRISTINE'S SOMETIME ROOMMATE, IN A WESTEND APARTMENT COMPLETE WITH A TWO-WAY BEDROOM MIRROR AND A TAPERECORDER BENEATH THE BED .

HE WAS RUSHED TOEDGWARE GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND PERHAPS DIED OF A HEART ATTACK . ON HISWRIST WAS A GOLD BRACELET WHOSE INSIDE, AS A HOSPITAL ATTENDANTDESCRIBED IT, WAS COVERED WITH SERIES OF NUMBERS THAT COULD BE EITHERSAFE COMBINATIONS OR ACCOUNT NUMBERS IN SWISS BANKS . WHATEVER RACHMANDID WITH HIS REPUTED FORTUNE, OF $25 MILLION, IT WAS NOT FOUND IN HISPERSONAL ESTATE, WHICH CAME TO ABOUT $20,000 . RACHMAN'S OWN FATE IS ASMYSTERIOUS AS HIS MISSING MONEY . THE LONDON UNDERWORLD BUZZES WITHRUMORS THAT THERE WAS A BODY SWITCH AT EDGWARE, AND RACHMAN HASREPORTEDLY BEEN SEEN EVERYWHERE FROM MANHATTAN TO PARIS . THE QUESTIONWAS RAISED IN PARLIAMENT, BUT LAST WEEK SCOTLAND YARD AND INVESTIGATINGNEWSMEN WERE SATISFIED THAT THE REAL RACHMAN WAS DEAD AND THAT HISCORPSE LIES BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE IN A HERTFORDSHIRE CEMETERY .
