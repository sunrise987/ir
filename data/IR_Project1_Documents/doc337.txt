SAYS LEOPOLDSEDAR SENGHOR, WHO IS BLACK AFRICA'S MOST DISTINGUISHED POET AS WELL ASPRESIDENT OF SENEGAL : " POETRY MUST FIND ITS WAY BACK TO ITS ORIGINS. " THE ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE AND REVIVE THESE ORIGINS IS ILLUSTRATED IN ANEW ANTHOLOGY, POEMS FROM BLACK AFRICA (INDIANA UNIVERSITY PRESS ;$4.95), EDITED BY U.S . NEGRO POET LANGSTON HUGHES .

" MOST OF THE BLACK NEW WAVE POETS ARECONCERNED WITH NEGRITUDE, A FRENCH WORD FOR THE ESSENCE OF BLACKNESSAND, BY EXTENSION, FOR A WORLD IN WHICH DESPAIR IS WHITE, WHILE GOD ANDINNOCENCE ARE BLACK . MANY WRITERS CELEBRATE NATURE AND MEMORIES OF APRISTINE AFRICA . MOST ARE PREOCCUPIED BY THE WEST'S FAILURE TOUNDERSTAND THEM . BUT IN THEIR POETRY IF NOT IN THEIR U.N .
