ITALY'S NEW PARTNERSHIP/ THIS IS OIL AND WATER, " CRACKED ITALY'S NEWFOREIGN MINISTER GIUSEPPE SARAGAT . THE NEW CENTER-LEFT COALITION,OUTGROWTH OF THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT) WHICHSTARTED ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, LAST WEEK FINALLY MANAGED TO FORM ACABINET . IN ADDITION TO THE PREMIERSHIP, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WOUNDUP WITH 15 OF THE 26 CABINET POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE KEY MINISTRIES OFDEFENSE, TREASURY, AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS . ALONG WITH THE VICEPREMIERSHIP, THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS GOT FIVE MORE POSTS, THE ONLYIMPORTANT ONE BEING THE BUDGET MINISTRY . FOUR CABINET JOBS WENT TO THESOLIDLY ANTI-COMMUNIST SOCIAL DEMOCRATS (INCLUDING SARAGAT'S FOREIGNMINISTRY) AND THE MODERATE REPUBLICANS . ITALY'S 25TH CABINET IN 20YEARS JOINS PARTIES OF DIFFERENT AIMS INTO AN ALLIANCE BASED ON WHATEACH SIDE HOPEFULLY TAKES TO BE EXPEDIENCY : THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATSWANT SOCIALIST SUPPORT FOR A FAR-RANGING PACKAGE OF REFORMS ; THESOCIALISTS WANT TO EXERCISE POWER AFTER 16 YEARS IN POLITICAL EXILE .AS ODDLY MATCHED AS THE PARTIES THEMSELVES ARE THEIR TWO LEADERS, FORTHE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE KEY POLITICAL FIGURES IN ITALY .PREMIER ALDO MORO, 47, ISTHE ANTITHESIS OF THE VOLUBLE, EMOTIONAL ITALIAN . A RESERVED ONETIMELAW PROFESSOR, HE DETESTS THE ACID NAME CALLING OF ITALIAN POLITICS, ISSO SHY THAT HE OFTEN TRAVELS BY CAR TO AVOID THE NECESSARY SOCIALAMENITIES ON PLANES AND TRAINS . MORO'S POLITICAL GENIUS IS FORCOMPROMISE, SOMETIMES ACHIEVED BY PURE TENACITY . HE ONCE REDUCED ACOLLEAGUE TO NEAR COLLAPSE BY ARGUING REASONABLY FOR FOUR UNINTERRUPTEDHOURS . SO CONSCIENTIOUSLY CAPABLE IS MORO OF SEEING ALL SIDES OF EVERYQUESTION THAT FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE ARE CONVINCED THAT HE AGREES ONLYWITH THEM . MORO'S COLORLESS CAUTION WAS THE VERY QUALITY THAT BOOSTEDHIM TO POLITICAL PROMINENCE . FIVE YEARS AGO, AFTER SHARP-TONGUEDAMINTORE FANFANI QUIT IN A HUFF AS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN ADISPUTE OVER HIS THEN STILL HEAVILY OPPOSED PLANS FOR AN OPENING TO THELEFT PARTY ELDERS LOOKED FOR A REPLACEMENT . HE HAD TO BE A MAN NOBODYWAS MAD AT, AND MORO FILLED THE BILL . ALTHOUGH FANFANI LATER BECAMEPREMIER FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, MORO STAYED ON AS THE PARTY'S CHIEFSTRATEGIST . NO LESS VIGOROUS THAN FANFANI IN HIS ADVOCACY OF THECENTER-LEFT ALLIANCE, MORO AT THE SAME TIME WAS MORE MILITANTLYANTI-COMMUNIST THAN FANFANI AND THEREFORE PROVED FAR MORE PERSUASIVEWHEN IT CAME TO SELLING CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS ON THE SCHEME. PROPHETICALLY, MORO HAD ONCE TRIED TO JOIN THE SOCIALIST PARTY BUTWAS TURNED DOWN AS BEING " TOO CATHOLIC . " A DEVOUT CHURCHGOER WHOATTENDS MASS DAILY, HE WAS BORN IN LECCE IN THE HEEL OF ITALY'S BOOT,STUDIED LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BARI, AT 24 BEGAN TEACHING . ENTERINGPARLIAMENT IN 1946, THE NEWCOMER WAS NICKNAMED BY HIS COLLEAGUES " THEQUAKER " BECAUSE OF HIS DOUR OUTLOOK AND AUSTERE HABITS . THROUGH SHEERDILIGENCE, MORO BECAME UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN 1948,RECEIVED HIS OWN MINISTRY (JUSTICE) IN 1955 . HOWEVER, HIS SPEECHES ASA POLITICIAN SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE STILL ADDRESSING LAW STUDENTS ATBARI, CONTAINED SO MANY PEDANTIC ABSTRACTIONS THAT DECIPHERING HISMEANINGS GAVE RISE TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF EXPERTS KNOWN AS "MOROLOGISTS . /MARRIED, FATHER OFFOUR DAUGHTERS AND ONE SON, MORO LIVES UNPRETENTIOUSLY IN ALOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS APARTMENT DISTRICT IN ROME . HIS WIFE, WHO ALMOSTNEVER APPEARS IN PUBLIC WITH HIM, OWNS FEW FANCY FURS OR JEWELS .OUTSIDE OF HIS FAMILY, MORO'S ONLY NONPOLITICAL PASSION IS FLOWERS,WHICH HE RAISES AT A SMALL COUNTRY HOUSE ABOUT 30 MILES FROOM ROME . "THERE, " HE SAYS, " I AM PERFECTLY AT EASE BECAUSE I AM WITH MYCHILDREN AND MY ROSES . " VICE PREMIER PIETRO NENNI, 72, IS ASIMPULSIVE AS MORO IS DELIBERATE . WHILE MORO ACHIEVES AGREEMENT THROUGHPATIENCE, NENNI OFTEN GETS HIS WAY BY SHEER CHARM AND ELOQUENCE . INMORE THAN HALF A CENTURY, HIS CAREER HAS FOLLOWED INNUMERABLE TWISTSAND TURNS . EVEN AS A YOUTH IN ROMAGNA, IN ITALY'S RUGGED NORTH, NENNIWAS AN ADEPT AT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY . AFTER HIS PEASANT PARENTS DIED,HE WAS PLACED IN AN ORPHANAGE BY AN ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY . EVERY SUNDAYNENNI RECITED HIS CATECHISM BEFORE THE COUNTESS AND IF HE DID WELLRECEIVED A SILVER COIN . " GENEROUS BUT HUMILIATING, " HE RECALLED . HEBECAME A SOCIALIST AND BEFRIENDED A FELLOW ROMAGNAN NAMED BENITOMUSSOLINI . IL DUCE'S FASCIST THUGS LATER ALMOST SHOT NENNI WHEN THEYRAIDED AND BURNED HIS SOCIALIST HEADQUARTERS IN MILAN . NENNI FLED TOFRANCE, AND DURING THE NEXT 17 YEARS FOUGHT ON THE LOYALIST SIDE INSPAIN, WAS CAPTURED BY THE NAZIS IN OCCUPIED FRANCE DURING WORLD WARII, TURNED OVER TO ITALIAN POLICE, AND DEPORTED TO THE LONELY ISLAND OFPONZA IN THE TYRRHENIAN SEA IN 1943 . THREE DAYS AFTER NENNI ARRIVED,THE SHORTLIVED GOVERNMENT OF MARSHAL BADOGLIO SHIPPED ANOTHER EXILE TOPONZA : MUSSOLINI . NENNI MADE HIS WAY TO ROME, BECAME FOREIGNMINISTER AND VICE PREMIER IN A COALITION CABINET THAT INCLUDEDCOMMUNISTS . WITH A BERET PUSHED TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND HIS BULLVOICE ROARING, NENNI DEMANDED " UNITY OF THE WORKING CLASS, "FAITHFULLY BACKED MOSCOW . STALIN REWARDED HIM WITH A PEACE PRIZE IN1951 . SLOWLY NENNI REALIZED THAT THE SOCIALISTS WERE CAPTIVES OF THEITALIAN COMMUNISTS . YET HE COULD NOT ESCAPE WITHOUT SHATTERING HISPARTY, WHICH WAS HEAVILY INFILTRATED BY REDS . FINALLY, MOSCOW'S BRUTALCRUSHING OF THE HUNGARIAN REBELLION AND KHRUSHCHEV'S DESTALINIZATIONSPEECH IN 1956 GAVE NENNI THE CHANCE HE WAS LOOKING FOR : HE BROKE HIS/ ACTION PACT " WITH THE COMMUNISTS, ALTHOUGH THE PARTY STILL PRESERVEDCLOSE TIES WITH THEM . NENNI ALSO RETURNED THE STALIN PRIZE MONEY($25,000), WHICH HE HAD USED TO BUY A LUXURIOUS SEASIDE VILLA . INROME, NENNI LIVES MORE MODESTLY IN AN APARTMENT WITH HIS WIFE AND ONEOF HIS THREE DAUGHTERS, GIULIANA, A SOCIALIST SENATOR . IN FRAIL HEALTHHE FELL IN A MOUNTAIN STREAM 17 MONTHS AGO AND INJURED HIS HEAD NENNINEEDED ALL HIS POWERS TO PERSUADE HIS SHARPLY DIVIDED PARTY TO ENTERTHE CENTER-LEFT COALITION . AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING, NENNI HASLIVED DOWN THE BOAST HE UTTERED 16 YEARS AGO : " NOT EVEN A REVOLVERPRESSED AGAINST MY HEAD WILL MAKE ME BREAK WITH THE COMMUNISTS . /
