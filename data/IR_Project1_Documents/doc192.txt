FOR THEDIPLOMATIC RECORD, RUSK OFFICIALLY WAS REPAYING A 1961 VISIT TOWASHINGTON BY YUGOSLAV FOREIGN MINISTER KOCA POPOVIC . BUT THERE WASMORE TO RUSK'S COURTESY CALL THAN THAT . U.S.-YUGOSLAV RELATIONS WERENEVER REALLY WARM ; SINCE THE U.S . CONGRESS LAST SUMMER SERVED NOTICETHAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE BELGRADE'S " MOST FAVORED NATION " TRADINGCLAUSE THIS YEAR, THEY HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY CHILLY . MARSHAL TITO'SOSTENTATIOUSLY FRIENDLY TRIP TO MOSCOW LAST YEAR DID NOT IMPROVEMATTERS, EITHER . BUT BELGRADE WAS ANXIOUS TO ASSURE THE U.S . THAT ITWAS OFFICIALLY STILL " UNALIGNED, " AND TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER, RUSKAGREED AT THE LAST MINUTE TO MAKE HIS VISIT . POPOVIC WAS OUT AT MODERNSUCRIN AIRPORT TO GREET RUSK WHEN THE BIG U.S . JET TOUCHED DOWN . ALSOON HAND WAS A RED CARPET AND A MILITARY BAND . BUT THAT WAS THE END OFTHE FANFARE . SINCE THE YUGOSLAVS DO NOT UNFURL FOREIGN FLAGS ALONG THENEW AUTOPUT THAT LEADS FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE CITY EXCEPT FOR AVISITING CHIEF OF STATE, RUSK'S ROUTE WAS LINED WITH BLUEAND-WHITEFINNISH BANNERS IN PLACE FOR PRESIDENT URHO K . KEKKONEN'S ARRIVAL NEXTDAY . THERE WERE NO CROWDS AT ALL, SINCE THE YUGOSLAVS DID NOT BOTHERTO ANNOUNCE RUSK'S TRIP IN ADVANCE . AFTER LUNCH WITH POPOVIC AND ARECEPTION AT THE U.S . EMBASSY GIVEN BY RETIRING U.S . AMBASSADORGEORGE KENNAN, RUSK PAID A CALL ON TITO IN HIS BELGRADE VILLA .YUGOSLAVIA HAS SOME 1956 VINTAGE U.S . MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR WHICHTITO WOULD LIKE SPARE PARTS ; SINCE 50 PER CENT OF YUGOSLAVIA'SCOMMERCE IS WITH THE WEST, IT IS WORRIED ABOUT THE RISING TARIFF WALLSOF THE SIX-NATION COMMON MARKET . NATURALLY, TITO RAISED THE PROBLEM OF/ MOST FAVORED " NATION STATUS WHICH, IF ELIMINATED, COULD SHARPLYBOOST IMPORT LEVIES ON YUGOSLAVIA'S $30 MILLION ANNUAL TRADE WITH THEU.S . RUSK COULD OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT THE CLAUSE WOULD BE RESTORED,SINCE THE DECISION IS UP TO CONGRESS . ON THE WHOLE, IT WAS A PLEASANTIF INCONCLUSIVE CHAT .
