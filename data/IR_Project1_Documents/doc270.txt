AFRICA ALBERT SCHWEITZER : AN ANACHRONISM STILL THEY COME, ALLYEAR ROUND, TO SEE THE FAMED OLD MAN IN HIS STORIED JUNGLE SETTING .PUBLIC FIGURES LIKE ADLAI STEVENSON, STARRY-EYED U.S . PEACE CORPSMEN,SPINSTER SCHOOLTEACHERS REALIZING A LONGSTANDING DREAM ALL COME FOR AVISIT TO DR . ALBERT SCHWEITZER . AT HIS MISSION THREE MILES UPSTREAMFROM THE GABONESE VILLAGE OF LAMBARENE, " THE GREAT WHITE DOCTOR, " NOW88, AFFABLY GREETS THEM, AUTOGRAPHING HIS BOOKS IN A FINE, STEADY HAND. YET, AFTER DEVOTING NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF HIS LIFE MINISTERING TO THESICK OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA AND BEING WIDELY REGARDED AS A NEAR SAINT,SCHWEITZER IS AN ANACHRONISM IN TODAY'S AFRICA . AFTER A JOURNEY TOLAMBARENE, TIME CORRESPONDENT JON RANDAL REPORTED WHY : ONCE, TO SEESCHWEITZER, TRAVELERS HAD TO BE PADDLED THE 175 MILES FROM PORTGENTILON THE ATLANTIC . NOW THEY ARRIVE BY AIR FROM THE GABONESE CAPITAL OFLIBREVILLE AND PUT DOWN AT LAMBARENE'S MODERN AIRPORT, NOT FAR FROM AMODERN, ANTISEPTIC GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL . ON THE SHORT TRIP UP THEOGOOUE RIVER, THE VISITORS PASS NATIVES SKIMMING BY IN BRAND-NEW BOATSPOWERED BY EVINRUDE OUTBOARDS . FINALLY THEY REACH SCHWEITZER'SHOSPITAL . SET GHOSTLIKE AMID WILD PALMS AND TANGLED JUNGLEUNDERGROWTH, ITS TIN ROOFS AND RAMSHACKLE WOODEN BUILDINGS ARE WORTHYOF RAIN OR THE HEART OF DARKNESS . CHANGELESS ISOLATION . IN THEHALFCENTURY SINCE SCHWEITZER CAME TO LAMBARENE WITH HIS WIFE HELENE ANDPERFORMED HIS FIRST OPERATION IN A CONVERTED HEN HOUSE, THE MISSION HASEXPANDED BUT OTHERWISE CHANGED LITTLE . AT THE RIVER LANDING THERE AREONLY PIROGUES, CRUDE DUGOUT CANOES, THE ONE TYPE OF RIVER AMBULANCESCHWEITZER WILL USE . ( " BRANCARDIER ! BRANCARDIER ! " (STRETCHERBEARER) THE OARSMEN CRY WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH AN EMERGENCY.) THEHOSPITAL COMPOUND IS WITHOUT TELEPHONE, RUNNING WATER OR REFRIGERATION,HAS ELECTRICITY ONLY IN THE MAIN BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE TINY,ANTIQUATED OPERATING THEATER . STERILIZATION IS CARRIED OUT IN ANOUTDOOR LEAN-TO AND THE ONLY TOILET IS AN OUTHOUSE FOR THE USE OF THEFOREIGN STAFF . WITH A CAPACITY FOR SOME 400 PATIENTS, SCHWEITZER'SCLINIC IS FOREVER JAMMED . THE SICK, CARRYING PAPER TAGS WITH THEIRNAMES, VILLAGES AND TRIBES, WAIT FOR HOURS TO SEE THE DOCTORS, AREBEDDED DOWN ON STRAW-MATTRESS COTS IN DARK, STENCH-RIDDEN HUTS WHOSEEARTH FLOORS ARE AWASH DURING THE RAINY SEASON . OUTSIDE, OVER OPENFIRES, THE PATIENTS' WOMEN RELATIVES COOK, WHILE A HORDE OF CHICKENS,DOGS AND GOATS (PROTECTED UNDER SCHWEITZER'S " REVERENCE FOR LIFE "MYSTIQUE BY WHICH NO LIVING THING SHOULD BE UNNECESSARILY DISTURBED)ROAM AT WILL, ADDING FREELY TO THE SURROUNDING FILTH . WHEN A PATIENTDIES AND HIS BODY IS UNCLAIMED, IT IS WRAPPED IN A FERN-ANDPALM-LEAFSHROUD, LAID IN A WOODEN BOX, AND BURIED IN THE BUSH . TAILORED FORPRIMITIVES . DESPITE SUCH SQUALOR, SCHWEITZER'S INSTITUTION HAS A GOODMEDICAL RECORD, AND THE CITY'S EUROPEANS GENERALLY CHOOSE IT OVER THENEW GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL . FEW HOSPITALS ANYWHERE CAN OFFER SUCH ADEDICATED STAFF, OR ONE THAT LIVES AS AUSTERELY . EACH OF THE DOCTORSAND NURSES OCCUPIES A SINGLE ROOM EQUIPPED WITH IRON BED, ENAMEL WASHBASIN AND KEROSENE LAMP ; MEALS USUALLY CONSIST OF FRIED BANANAS ANDOTHER FRUIT . THE OLD MAN STUBBORNLY REFUSES TO GO MODERN . SAYS HE :/ CIRCUMSTANCES COMMAND THAT THE HOSPITAL BE PRIMITIVE IN KEEPING WITHTHE PRIMITIVE STATE OF THE PEOPLE . " HE BELIEVES THAT AFRICANS ENJOYDISCOMFORT, AND THAT THEY ARE OFTEN AFRAID OF A GLEAMING WHITE MODERNHOSPITAL, BUT NOT OF ONE THAT REMINDS THEM OF THEIR VILLAGES A CONCEPTLESS VALID TODAY THAN 20 YEARS AGO . HIS AFRICAN CRITICS TAKESCHWEITZER'S INSISTENCE ON PRIMITIVENESS AS AN INSULT, OR A NEEDLESSPROLONGATION OF " THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN . " SYMBOLICALLY, THEY POINTOUT, HE AND HIS STAFF STILL WEAR PITH HELMETS . THE CONCEPT THAT THEDARK CONTINENT CAN MAKE MORE PROGRESS THROUGH INDEPENDENCE IS, TOSCHWEITZER, FOLLY . TOLD THAT THE PEACE CORPS IS BUILDING PRIMARYSCHOOLS ALL OVER GABON, AND THAT THE LITTLE COUNTRY HAS 14 MEDICALSTUDENTS TRAINING IN FRANCE, DR . SCHWEITZER MERELY CHUCKLES AND SAYSOF THE BLACKS : " YOU CANNOT CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY . " AMONG HIS SIXDOCTORS AND 17 NURSES, THERE IS NOT ONE AFRICAN, NOR IS HE TRAINING ANY. SAYS AN UPPER-CLASS AFRICAN IN LAMBARENE : " I'D RATHER DIEUNATTENDED THAN BE HUMILIATED AT DR . SCHWEITZER'S HOSPITAL . "ACCORDING TO THE SUN . BUSHY WHITE HAIR AFLARE, DROOPING MUSTACHEAQUIVER, COTTON STRIPS WOUND AROUND HIS ARMS TO ABSORB THE SWEAT, HE ISA LITTLE DEAF BUT ALERT AS A LION . HE IS STILL PLANNING ADDITIONS TOTHE HOSPITAL AND IS WORKING ON VOLUME III OF THE PHILOSOPHY OFCIVILIZATION . A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO MOREREST VISITS TO EUROPE, WHICH HIS DISCIPLES TAKE TO MEAN THAT SCHWEITZERWANTS TO DIE AT LAMBARENE, WHERE HIS WIFE WAS BURIED SIX YEARS AGO . INTHE JUNGLE, THE DOCTOR HAS BUILT A PRIVATE WORLD FOR HIMSELF WHICH HEREFUSES TO ALTER . EVEN HIS TIME IS HIS OWN ; THE HOSPITAL CLOCKS DONOT RUN ON G.M.T., LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, BUT ARE SETACCORDING TO THE SUN . AS FAR BACK AS WORLD WAR I, SCHWEITZER EXPRESSEDHIS DISLIKE FOR THE MODERN WORLD OUTSIDE : " IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENTWAYS MANKIND HAS BEEN PERSUADED TO GIVE UP ITS NATURAL RELATIONS WITHREALITY AND TO SEEK ITS WELFARE IN THE MAGIC FORMULAS OF SOME KIND OFECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WITCHCRAFT . " SCHWEITZER HAS MADE HIS OWN REALITY; HE LIVES IN THE AFRICA OF 1913, HARDLY KNOWING OR CARING THAT ACONTINENT AND A CENTURY HAVE PASSED HIM BY .
