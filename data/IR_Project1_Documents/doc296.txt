COMMUNISTS WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR SCARCELY HAD THE SINO-SOVIET TALKSGOTTEN UNDERWAY THAN THE MEETING HEADED FOR COLLAPSE . IT DID NOT MUCHMATTER WHEN RED CHINA'S SEVEN-MAN DELEGATION WOULD PACK THEIR BAGS ANDACTUALLY LEAVE MOSCOW ; BACK HOME PEKING'S PEOPLE'S DAILY SEEMED READYTO CALL IT QUITS . " WE WANT UNITY, NOT A SPLIT, " SAID THE VOICE OFRED CHINA . " BUT WE HAVE TO POINT OUT WITH HEAVY HEARTS THAT EVENTSHAVE GONE CONTRARY TO OUR HOPES . THE SITUATION IS VERY GRAVE . "ABSOLUTE SECRECY . ALL WEEK THERE HAD BEEN A STRANGE SENSATION INMOSCOW THAT MAYBE THERE WAS NO SINO-SOVIET MEETING AT ALL . THE KREMLINACTED AS THOUGH THE SHOWDOWN NEVER TOOK PLACE . DOM PRIEMOV, THERECEPTION HOUSE WHERE THE SESSIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELD, WASCAREFULLY AVOIDED BY SOVIET REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS . ASKED WHY, AMOSCOW NEWS EXECUTIVE SAID SARCASTICALLY : " IT'S PAYDAY . THEY'VE ALLGONE FOR THEIR MONEY . " AFTER MEETING TWICE TO DISCUSS FORMALITIES,THE RUSSIANS AND RED CHINESE MET ONLY THREE TIMES DURING THE NEXT SEVENDAYS . JUST BEFORE ONE SESSION BEGAN, A WESTERN REPORTER ASKED A SOVIETPLAINCLOTHESMAN WHAT TIME THE PEKING DELEGATION WAS EXPECTED . THE COPSHRUGGED AND SAID : " YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THEM . THEY ARE A VERYDISORGANIZED PEOPLE . WE WAITED FOR THEM YESTERDAY, AND THEY NEVER DIDSHOW UP . " THE RED CHINESE DELEGATION APPARENTLY SPENT MOST OF ITSTIME DRIVING THROUGH THE LENIN HILLS SECTION OF THE CITY IN BLACKLIMOUSINES, SHUTTLING MYSTERIOUSLY FROM PEKING'S EMBASSY TO DOM PRIEMOVTO THE VILLA WHERE THEY LIVED . WESTERN NEWSMEN ONCE GLIMPSED TENGHSIAO-PING, THE LEADER OF PEKING'S GROUP, SERENELY STROLLING THROUGHTHE VILLA'S GARDENS . THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE BEHIND THE MASSIVE,CREAM-COLORED WALLS OF DOM PRIEMOV WERE THE BOOTS OF A SOVIET SOLDIER,WHICH PROTRUDED BENEATH THE SPIKED IRON GATES WHEN HE OPENED A PEEPHOLETO SCRUTINIZE AN ARRIVING AUTOMOBILE . FOR THE FIRST TIME, RUSSIANSWERE WILLING TO TALK AND EVEN TO JOKE ABOUT THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT .ONE CRACK MAKING THE ROUNDS IN MOSCOW SUGGESTED THAT THE WAY TO SOLVETHE WHOLE THING WAS FOR MAO TSE-TUNG AND CHARLES DE GAULLE TO CONCLUDEAN ALLIANCE, THUS LETTING THE TWO TROUBLEMAKERS TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. ABSOLUTE EQUALITY . TRHOUGHOUT THE ON-AND-OFF MEETINGS, THEIDEOLOGICAL FIRE CONTINUED ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE DELEGATES . THEKREMLIN SPLASHED A POLICY STATEMENT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF PRAVDA THATOMINOUSLY WARNED PEKING OF THE " DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES " OF ITS POLICY. AS FOR NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, HE CALLED OUT THE BRASS BANDS, HONOR GUARDAND TELEVISION CAMERAS TO WELCOME HUNGARY'S JANOS KADAR, WHO REPAID THEFLATTERY BY ONCE AGAIN BACKING MOSCOW'S LINE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE .RED CHINA, WHOSE DELEGATION'S ARRIVAL IN MOSCOW WAS DOWNPLAYED BY THESOVIET GOVERNMENT AND DELIBERATELY IGNORED BY THE SOVIET PRESS, FIREDITS OWN VOLLEY OF INSULTS . FOR THE FIRST TIME, PEKING CLAIMED ABSOLUTEEQUALITY WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION AND WARNED THEKREMLIN IN AN ELABORATE SIMILE : " NO GENUINE UNITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BYAN ATTITUDE THAT ALLOWS THE MAGISTRATE TO BURN DOWN HOUSES, WHILEFORBIDDING THE COMMON PEOPLE EVEN TO LIGHT THEIR LAMPS . " ALL THESESINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES WERE CAREFULLY FRAMED TO PUT THE BLAME FOR THESPLIT ON THE OTHER FELLOW . OBVIOUSLY THE CHINESE NEVER EXPECTED THEMOSCOW MEETING TO SUCCEED, INSISTED ON IT MERELY TO EMBARRASS THESOVIETS . THE KREMLIN, IN TURN, COULD NOT AFFORD TO APPEAR INTRACTABLE. AT WEEK'S END THE PEKING PRESS SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS A FEW OF THESINO-SOVIET DIFFERENCES COULD BE SETTLED SOON, WHILE OTHERS COULD BEDEFERRED TILL LATER . THIS SIMPLY MEANT THAT THE CHINESE WERE READY TOPROLONG THE QUARREL INDEFINITELY . " IF THE DIFFERENCES CANNOT BERESOLVED THIS YEAR, " SAID PEKING BLANDLY, " THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL NEXTYEAR . " THE RUSSIANS ARE LESS PATIENT . THEY SHOT BACK AN ANSWERINGCOMMUNIQUE WARNING PEKING THAT " THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE " WILL DECIDEWHETHER THE SPLIT WILL WIDEN . THEN MOSCOW GAVE THE RED CHINESE AND THEWEST A POINTED REMINDER . AFTER ALL, SAID THE SOVIETS, " WE HAVE ACOMMON ENEMY . /
