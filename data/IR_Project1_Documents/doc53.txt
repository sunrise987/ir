WESTERN EUROPE ROUND 1 TO THE GENERAL IF MOST OF EUROPESEEMED ANGRY AT CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK, NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOWQUITE WHAT TO DO ABOUT HIM . SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER AT THE EUROPEANPARLIAMENT IN STRASBOURG RINGINGLY CONDEMNED CHARLES DE GAULLE'SIMPERIOUS THUMBS DOWN ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET . AS ARESULT, DECLARED COMMON MARKET CHAIRMAN WALTER HALLSTEIN, THE SIX HAVEBEEN PLUNGED INTO THEIR " FIRST REAL CRISIS A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE . "IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS FROM BONN TO ROME, FRANCE'S COMMON MARKET PARTNERSSPOKE BRAVELY OF GANGING UP ON DE GAULLE, PERHAPS BY BLOCKING HIS PLANSFOR ASSOCIATING FRANCE'S FORMER AFRICAN COLONIES WITH EUROPE, OR EVENBY BOYCOTTING FRENCH GOODS . EMPTY CHAIR ? BUT WHEN THE SPEECHES WEREOVER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIANS SPEECHLESSLY REALIZED THAT THERE WASALMOST NO CONCRETE ACTION THAT THEY COULD TAKE AGAINST LE GRAND CHARLES. DE GAULLE SEEMED TO HOLD ALL THE TRUMPS . SOME MEMBERS OF THE OTHERCOMMON MARKET FIVE HAD TALKED OF GIVING FRANCE THE " EMPTY-CHAIR "TREATMENT, CARRYING ON THEIR EFFORTS FOR EUROPEAN UNITY AND ATLANTICPARTNERSHIP WITHOUT THE FRENCH . YET WHAT PURPOSE WOULD IT SERVE TOEXCLUDE FRANCE FROM NATO COUNCILS ? NONE AT ALL . ITS CONTRIBUTIONSTO ALLIED FIGHTING STRENGTH ARE SUFFICIENTLY MEAGER IT IS TWO DIVISIONSBEHIND ITS COMMITMENTS IN GERMANY, IT WITHHOLDS ITS MEDITERRANEAN FLEETFROM NATO, KEEPS MOST OF ITS METROPOLITAN TERRITORY OUT OF THE AIRWARNING SYSTEM, AND EVEN PROHIBITS FOREIGN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON FRENCHSOIL . STILL, SHEER GEOGRAPHY GIVES FRANCE A VETO ON NATO PLANNING .COULD FRANCE BE IGNORED IN THE TARIFF DISCUSSIONS OF THE 40-ODD MEMBERSOF GATT, OR IN OECD, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COORDINATING GROUP THAT GREWOUT OF THE MARSHALL PLAN ? HARDLY, SINCE THE ECONOMIES OF ALL WESTERNEUROPEAN NATIONS ARE INTERTWINED WITH FRANCE'S . THE URGENT FRENCH NEEDTO EXPORT FOOD SURPLUSES, AND ITS BOOMING MARKET FOR OTHER NATIONS'INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARE THE STICK AND THE CARROT THAT HAVE GIVEN THECOMMUNITY MUCH OF ITS MOMENTUM . EVEN BELGIUM'S PAUL-HENRI SPAAK,PERHAPS THE MOST IMPLACABLE FOE OF DE GAULLE'S PLANS FOR EUROPE, AGREEDLAST WEEK THAT THERE WAS NO GENERAL SUPPORT FOR RETALIATORY MEASURESAGAINST FRANCE . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, WHOWAS IN TEARS AT BRUSSELS WHEN FRANCE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN, WENT HOMEBREATHING DEFIANCE OF DE GAULLE AND THREATS TO TOPPLE KONRAD ADENAUERNOWHERE (SEE BELOW) . AND AFTER ALL THE ORATORY AT STRASBOURG, A "SOLEMN PROTEST " MOTION CONDEMNING DE GAULLE'S " DOMINATION " OF EUROPEWAS IGNOMINIOUSLY DEFEATED BY A TIE VOTE OF 38-38 HARDLY A RESOUNDINGGESTURE OF DEFIANCE . PERSONALITY CHANGE . BY THEIR VERY LACK OFPASSION AT THE NEW REALITIES, EUROPEAN STATESMEN PROVED THAT THERE ISSTILL A LOT OF LIFE IN DEEP-ROOTED NATIONALISM, WHETHER DE GAULLE'S ORANYONE ELSE'S . THE COMMUNISTS HAD FOUND OUT THE SAME THING INYUGOSLAVIA, POLAND, HUNGARY AND EAST GERMANY . THERE WERE DIFFERENCES: RUSSIA HAD TRIED TO IMPOSE A UNITY, AND WESTERN EUROPEANS HAD HOPEDTO EVOLVE INTO A UNITY BY DEMOCRATIC MEANS AND FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT .WESTERN EUROPEANS STILL INSIST THAT THE IDEA OF EUROPE WILL CARRY THEDAY, BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF ONE ANOTHER'SDISPARATE TASTES, TALENTS AND DESTINIES . THE FRENCH, AWARE OF THEHOSTILITY OF ALLIES, WERE REASSURING EVERYBODY THAT THEY WERE NOTPROPOSING TO GO IT ALONE . FOREIGN MINISTER COUVE DE MURVILLE SAID : "IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF FREEING THE EUROPEAN PERSONALITY BUT OFREMAINING INSIDE THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE . " EVEN SO, EUROPE'SPERSONALITY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERGONE A CHANGE . SAID ONE MINISTER INBRUSSELS LAST WEEK : " FOR THE PRESENT, ONLY EXPECT THE THINGS TO BEDONE QUICKLY AROUND HERE THAT ARE PLAINLY GOOD FOR ALL THE SIXCOUNTRIES . IT WILL BE QUIT A WHILE BEFORE WE HEAR A MINISTER INCOUNCIL SAY HE IS VOTING FOR ANYTHING FOR THE GOOD THE COMMUNITY AS AWHOLE . /
