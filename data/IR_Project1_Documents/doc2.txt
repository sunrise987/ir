RUSSIA WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE ? IT WAS IN 1954 THAT NIKITAKHRUSHCHEV LAUNCHED HIS GRANDIOSE " VIRGIN LANDS " GAMBLE . PART OF THEPLAN WAS TO PLOW UP 32 MILLION ACRES OF MARGINAL LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN,AND SETTLE IT WITH COMMUNIST " PIONEERS, " WHO WERE TO PLANT ANDPRODUCE HUGE QUANTITIES OF DESPERATELY NEEDED GRAIN WITHIN TWO YEARS .NIKITA'S SCHEME FLOPPED . THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH RAINFALL, AND THEPIONEERS DID NOT TAKE TO TRACTOR LIFE ON THE BLEAK FRONTIER . EXCEPTFOR 1958, EACH HARVEST HAS BEEN LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S . WORSTYEAR OF ALL WAS 1962, WHEN THE VIRGIN LANDS DELIVERED ONLY HALF THEIRQUOTAS . NATURALLY, KHRUSHCHEV TAKES NONE OF THE BLAME FOR THE FIASCO .THREE YEARS AGO HE FOUND A SCAPEGOAT IN KAZAKHSTAN PARTY BOSS NIKOLAIBELYAEV, FIRED HIM FOR HIS " ERRORS . " LAST WEEK BELYAEV'S SUCCESSOR,DINMUKHAMED KUNAEV, WAS SIMILARLY BOUNCED FOR " LAPSES " IN HIS WORK .FOR GOOD MEASURE, MOSCOW ALSO PURGED THE FORMER PREMIER OF THETERRITORY FROM THE LOCAL PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE . IT WAS PERHAPS NOCOINCIDENCE THAT NIKOLAI IGNATOV, 61, A ONETIME KHRUSHCHEV CRONY, LASTWEEK ABRUPTLY LEFT HIS POST AS A SOVIET DEPUTY PREMIER AFTER ONLY NINEMONTHS ON THE JOB . FARM EXPERT IGNATOV HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE BOSSOF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO BOOST FOOD PRODUCTION .
