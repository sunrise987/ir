AUSTRALIA ASIANS, KEEP OUT ! , UNDERPOPULATED AUSTRALIA SPEND$30 MILLION IN 1963 TO ATTRACT NEW CITIZENS, SINCE WAR'S END HASINCREASED ITS POPULATION FROM 7.5 MILLION TO A MERE 11 MILLION . THATADDS UP TO FEWER INHABITANTS THAN PENNSYLVANIA HAS, IN AN AREA 66 TIMESLARGER . NONETHELESS, AUSTRALIA CLINGS TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOSTRESTRICTIVE IMMIGRATION LAWS, HAS TRADITIONALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINSTASIAN AND OTHER NONWHITE IMMIGRANTS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE WHATIMMIGRATION MINISTER ALEXANDER DOWNER HAS DESCRIBED AS " AN ANGLICANEUROPEAN COMMUNITY EMBODYING ALL THAT IS BEST OF THE OLD WORLD AND THENEW . " AUSTRALIA'S " IMMIGRATION APARTHEID " DATES FROM THE LATTERHALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY, WHEN 50,000 CHINESE FLOCKED THERE TO WORKFARMS AND GOLD MINES . WHITE COLONISTS, FEARFUL THAT THE NEWCOMERSWOULD DEPRESS WAGE LEVELS, CLAMORED FOR RESTRICTIVE LAWS . TODAY FEWERTHAN 80,000 ASIANS LIVE PERMANENTLY IN THE COUNTRY, AND EXPERIENCELITTLE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, BUT ONLY A FEW " DISTINGUISHED AND HIGHLYQUALIFIED ASIANS " ARE EVER GRANTED RESIDENCE PERMITS . WHIM CREEK .THE WHITE AUSTRALIA POLICY IS OFTEN CARRIED TO ABSURD, ESOTERICEXTREMES . RECENTLY, FIVE JAPANESE TECHNICIANS EMPLOYED BY AJAPANESE-CONTROLLED MINING CONCERN AT, OF ALL PLACES, WHIM CREEK INWESTERN AUSTRALIA WERE CONVICTED OF VIOLATING AN OBSCURE 1904 LAWSPECIFYING THAT " NO ASIATIC OR AFRICAN ALIEN SHALL BE EMPLOYED IN ANYCAPACITY WHATEVER IN OR ABOUT ANY MINE CLAIM . " AS A RESULT, WESTERNAUSTRALIA'S STATE LEGISLATURE LAST WEEK REPEALED THE LAW, BUT VIRTUALLYNEGATED ITS ACTION BY ADOPTING AN AMENDMENT SPECIFYING THAT ASIANS MUSTSTILL GET GOVERNMENT PERMITS TO WORK IN THE MINES . THERE IS EVEN LESSHOPE FOR LIBERALIZATION OF NATIONAL IMMIGRATION POLICIES, WHOSEPRINCIPAL VICTIMS ARE THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN OF MIXED MARRIAGES . ONETYPICAL CASE THIS MONTH INVOLVED AN INDIAN COUPLE WHO CAME TO AUSTRALIAIN 1962 TO LIVE WITH THEIR TWO SONS, BOTH OF WHOM ARE MARRIED TOAUSTRALIAN GIRLS, ONLY TO BE ORDERED OUT OF THE COUNTRY . SAID THEFATHER : " I'VE FOUND HELL IN AUSTRALIA . " SKEPTICAL NEIGHBORS .CRITICS OF THE WHITE AUSTRALIA POLICY, INCLUDING LEADING CHURCHMEN ANDEDUCATORS, OBJECT THAT ONLY THROUGH SELECTIVE ASIAN IMMIGRATION CAN THEGOVERNMENT HOPE TO ATTRACT ALL THE SKILLED CITIZENS IT NEEDS .MOREOVER, THEY ARGUE, AUSTRALIA CAN NEVER REALIZE ITS POTENTIAL AS ALEADER OF SOUTHEAST ASIA SO LONG AS ITS NEIGHBORS ARE CONVINCED THATAUSTRALIANS ARE WHITE SUPREMACISTS . PRIME MINISTER SIR ROBERT MENZIESIN FACT ORDERED MORE LIBERAL INTERPRETATION OF IMMIGRATION POLICY, BUTHE INSISTED DURING THE RECENT ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT HE WOULD NEVERPERMIT ANY BASIC REFORM IN THE LAW . TO DO SO, SAID HE, " WOULD CREATEIN AUSTRALIA THE KIND OF DREADFUL PROBLEMS THEY NOW HAVE IN OTHERCOUNTRIES . /
