GREECE  HUBRIS DOESN'T WIN  FOR COMMITTING THE SIN OF HUBRIS(OVERWEENING PRIDE), THE FATES TOPPLED THE HEROES OF ANCIENT GREECE .LAST WEEK GREEK VOTERS DEFEATED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PREMIERIN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, HANDSOME, HARD-DRIVINGCONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS, WHO HAD SHOWN MORE THAN A TOUCH OF HUBRIS WHENHE SAID IN A CAMPAIGN SPEECH:  "THE TRUE POLITICAL LEADER DOES NOT NEEDTHE PEOPLE . THE PEOPLE NEED THE TRUE POLITICAL LEADER ." DURING HISEIGHT-YEAR REIGN, KARAMANLIS HAD, AS HE SAID, "TRANSFORMED GREECEFROM AN ORIENTAL VILLAGE TO A EUROPEAN COUNTRY ." HE BROUGHT THE NATIONINTO THE COMMON MARKET AS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER, BUILT DAMS AND ROADS .ON THE AVERAGE, MANUFACTURING HAS GROWN AN IMPRESSIVE 8 PERCENT ANNUALLYIN THE PAST DECADE, GOVERNMENT RESERVES SHOT UP BY 400 PERCENT, ANDREVENUES MORE THAN DOUBLED - - THANKS IN PART TO TOURISM, WHICH THISYEAR GROSSED SOME $90 MILLION .  THERE ARE DARK SPOTS IN THIS SUNNYPICTURE -- SOME 100,000 YOUNG GREEKS HAVE EMIGRATED TO WEST GERMANY TOFIND JOBS, AND POVERTY RETAINS ITS GRIP ON PRIMITIVE MOUNTAIN VILLAGES .STREET PEDDLERS IN ATHENS STILL HAUL SPONGES, BANANAS AND CHESNUTS --BUT THEY NOW WALK BENEATH GLITTERING NEON SIGNS THAT REVEAL THEINTERNATIONALIZATION OF AN INCREASINGLY MODERN ECONOMY:  IBM, SIEMENS,HAIG & HAIG, DINERS CLUB . REJECTED ADVICE . STRONGLY ANTI-COMMUNIST ANDPRO-NATO, KARAMANLIS WELDED HIS RIGHT-WING NATIONAL RADICAL UNIONINTO A POWERFUL PARTY, GAVE GREECE THE LONGEST STRETCH OF POLITICALSTABILITY IN MODERN TIMES .  BUT THERE WERE PROTESTS, WHEN KARAMANLISWAS RE-ELECTED FOR A FOURTH TERM IN 1961, THAT POLICE IN THE BACKCOUNTRY HAD INTIMIDATED VOTERS .  THOUGH MANY ELECTION BRAWLS WEREDELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY LEFTISTS, THEY CONVINCED LEFT-WING BRITISHLABORITES AND OTHER ALLIES ABROAD THAT GREECE LIVED UNDER A TYRANNY .LAST JUNE, AFTERKING PAUL AND QUEEN FREDERIKA REJECTED KARAMANLIS' ADVICE TO CALL OFFA STATE VISIT TO BRITAIN BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF LEFTIST DEMONSTRATIONSIN LONDON, THE PREMIER QUIT IN A HUFF .  WHILE KARAMANLIS SULKED INA SWISS VILLA FOR THREE MONTHS AND A CARETAKER CABINET LED BY HISPOLITICAL ALLIES RULED THE COUNTRY, THE OPPOSITION CENTER UNION PARTYLAUNCHED AN INTENSE ELECTION CAMPAIGN .  IT WAS LED BY AN AGEDDEMOSTHENES, GEORGE PAPANDREOU, 75, VETERAN OF SEVERAL PREWAR CABINETSAND THE NATION'S FIRST POSTWAR PREMIER .  TO KARAMANLIS' BOAST THATGREECE HAS PROSPERED, PAPANDREOU REPLIED:  "NUMBERS PROSPER, THE PEOPLESUFFER ."  FARMERS, WHO HAD BENEFITED LEAST FROM THE BOOM BECAUSE OFLOW PRICES FOR THEIR GOODS, GOT PAPANDREOU'S EASY PROMISE THAT HE WOULDFORGIVE THEIR DEBTS .  ABOVE ALL, CAMPAIGNER PAPANDREOU CONCENTRATEDON THE OLD 1961 CHARGES OF ELECTION FRAUD, CRIED THAT HE WASDETERMINED TO SAVE THE NATION FROM THE "FASCIST AND TERRORIST" POLICIESOF KARAMANLIS .  NO THANKS .  KARAMANLIS, RELYING ON HIS IMPRESSIVEECONOMIC RECORD, CAMPAIGNED AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED THE PEOPLE TO THANKHIM FOR RUNNING .  TO THE SURPRISE OF ALMOST EVERYONE, THEY DIDN'T .A NEAR-RECORD TURNOUT OF 4,600,000 VOTERS GAVE PAPANDREOU'S CENTERUNION 140 SEATS IN THE 300-MEMBER PARLIAMENT; KARAMANLIS' NATIONALRADICALS GOT 128 .  WINNER PAPANDREOU CELEBRATED BY DANCING MOST OFTHE NIGHT .  KARAMANLIS WAS FURIOUS, HASTILY ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUITTINGPOLITICS .  AFTER A TALK WITH KING PAUL AT TATOI PALACE, HE CHANGEDHIS MIND .  AFTER ALL, PAPANDREOU LACKED A MAJORITY OF ELEVEN SEATS .THE PREMIER COULD HAVE A SAFE MARGIN IF HE ACCEPTED THE EAGER SUPPORTOF 30 PRO-COMMUNIST DEPUTIES, BUT SO FAR PRO-WESTERN PAPANDREOU HASREJECTED THE OFFER . BETWEEN NOW AND DEC . 11, WHEN PARLIAMENT CONVENES,KARAMANLIS HOPES TO ATTRACT ENOUGH DEPUTIES TO DEFEAT THE OPENING VOTEOF CONFIDENCE, IF HE SUCCEEDS, GREECE WILL BE IN FOR NEW ELECTIONSAND ANOTHER FREE-SWINGING CAMPAIGN .
