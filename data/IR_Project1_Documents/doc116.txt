FRANCE " GIVE US SOME SOUS " AS DAWN ROSE OVER PARIS EARLYONE MORNING LAST WEEK, A VOLLEY OF RIFLE SHOTS ECHOED THROUGH DANK,GRIM IVRY FORT . DEAD BEFORE THE FIRING SQUAD SANK EX-LIEUT . COLONELJEAN-MARIE BASTIEN-THIRY, 35, CONVICTED RINGLEADER OF LAST SUMMER'SABORTIVE ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE CHARLES DE GAULLE IN THE PARIS SUBURBOF PETITCLAMART AS HE WAS MOTORING TO HIS COUNTRY HOME ATCOLOMBEY-LES-DEUX-EGLISES. THOUGH DE GAULLE SPARED TWO OTHER PLOTTERS,HE PRESUMABLY ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF BASTIEN-THIRY TO DISCOURAGEOTHER TERRORISTS FROM FURTHER ASSASSINATION EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THEDREAD SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION . BUT DE GAULLE'S MOST PROMINENT FOE,EX-PREMIER GEORGES BIDAULT, NOW A RANKING S.A.O . CHIEFTAIN, WAS ASPUBLICLY DEFIANT AS EVER . HE COULD AFFORD TO BE, FOR HE WAS NOW HOLEDUP IN SOUTHERN GERMANY, WHERE, AFTER A NERVOUS BRUSHOFF BY CHANCELLORKONRAD ADENAUER, HE SOUGHT POLITICAL ASYLUM FROM THE STATE OF BAVARIA .BATHED IN PUBLICITY AND SURROUNDED BY POLICE, HE OBVIOUSLY WAS NOTDOING HIS RESISTANCE ORGANIZATION MUCH CONCRETE GOOD IN A DISTANTGERMAN VILLA . BUT WHEN HE CALLED REPORTERS IN FOR INTERVIEWS, BIDAULTINSISTED THAT HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE FAR FROM OVER . " I AM THELEADER OF THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE COUNCIL . I AM THE BOSS OF IT ALL, "HE BOASTED . IN FRANCE, THERE WAS ONLY OFFICIAL SILENCE . FACT WAS, THEFRENCH GOVERNMENT WAS DELIGHTED THAT THE TROUBLEMAKER WAS IN GERMANY,WHERE HE WAS UNDER CONTINUAL SURVEILLANCE, AND WAS BABBLING A LITTLETOO MUCH TO THE PRESS TO ENHANCE HIS REPUTATION . WITH BIDAULT ON ICE,DE GAULLE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE CONTINUING, CRIPPLING STRIKE OF188,000 MINERS IN THE NATIONALIZED COAL FIELDS OF NORTHERN FRANCE, WHOWERE DEMANDING WAGE SCALES ON A PAR WITH WORKERS IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY .RUMORS CIRCULATED THAT S.A.O . MEMBERS, DISGUISED AS COPS, WOULD ATTACKTHE STRIKERS TO PROVOKE THEM TO VIOLENCE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, BUTTHE ONLY TOLL OF THE STRIKE SO FAR WAS ECONOMIC . THOUSANDS OF STEELAND NATURAL GAS WORKERS WENT OUT ON A SYMPATHY STRIKE, AND A 24-HOURRAIL WALKOUT CREATED A TRANSPORTATION TIE-UP ALL OVER FRANCE . INTOPARIS DROVE A 342-CAR CONVOY OF SOME 2,000 LORRAINE IRONWORKERSCHANTING : " GIVE US SOME SOUS, POMPIDOU . " THOUGH FURIOUS AT THECONTINUED INTRANSIGENCE OF THE STRIKERS, DE GAULLE KNEW HE MIGHT HAVETO GIVE IN. AT A CABINET MEETING IN PARIS, HE ORDERED STUDIES DRAWN UPCOMPARING WAGES IN PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED INDUSTRY, WITH AN EYETOWARD MAKING ADJUSTMENTS . BUT HE WAS STILL RANKLED AT THE MONETARYSUPPORT GIVEN THE STRIKERS BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE NORTHERNCOAL AREAS . ASKED WHERE THE FUNDS WOULD COME FROM TO PAY FOR ANY WAGEHIKE, HE SUGGESTED WE COULD ALWAYS TAKE UP A COLLECTION IN THE CHURCHESTHESE DAYS, WITH TIGHTERPOLICE SECURITY, DE GAULLE USUALLY MAKES THE TRIP BETWEEN PARIS ANDCOLOMBEY BY HELICOPTER . ESCORTED BY A HEAVY POLICE GUARD, HE DRIVES AFEW MILES DOWN THE HIGHWAY TO AN ISOLATED, PREDETERMINED SPOT ON THEROAD . THERE, AS SHOWN WITH MME . DE GAULLE IN PHOTOGRAPHS RELEASEDTHIS WEEK (SEE CUTS), HE LEAVES HIS CAR, ENTERS THE WAITING HELICOPTER,AND MAKES HIS JOURNEY .FOR ONE THING, LE GRAND CHARLES WAS DOUBTLESS AWARE OF THE LATESTREPORT OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC OPINION, WHICH REVEALED THATDE GAULLE'S RATING HAD PLUMMETED NINE POINTS OVER THE PRECEDING MONTH,WITH ONLY 55 PER CENT OF THE FRENCH POPULACE NOW " SATISFIED " WITH HISCONDUCT OF THE PRESIDENCY . IT WAS DE GAULLE'S LOWEST READING IN 14MONTHS .
