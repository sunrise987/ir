COLD WAR TO MOSCOW, WITH CAUTION THE PATTERN OF ARRIVAL ANDDEPARTURE MIGHT BE SYMBOLIC . BY WEEK'S END EVERYONE IN MOSCOW BELIEVEDTHAT THE RED CHINESE DELEGATION WAS READY TO HEAD HOME BEFORE TOO LONG. AT THE SAME TIME, U.S . AND BRITISH DELEGATIONS WERE DUE TO ARRIVE .THE RUSSIANS WERE JAMMING RADIO PEKING BUT LET THE VOICE OF AMERICACOME IN LOUD AND CLEAR . FACED WITH THE OPEN CHINESE CHALLENGE TOSOVIET LEADERSHIP OF WORLD COMMUNISM, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV MAY WANT TOEASE TENSIONS WITH THE WEST, BOTH TO BULWARK HIS POSITION AT HOME ANDTO DEMONSTRATE THE GENUINENESS OF HIS MUCH-HERALDED COEXISTENCE POLICYABROAD . BUT WHETHER KHRUSHCHEV WANTS IT BADLY ENOUGH TO MAKE SOMEREALLY MEANINGFUL CONCESSIONS IS STILL ANOTHER QUESTION . THE ISSUES .AS HE FLEW OFF TO MOSCOW FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF TEST-BAN TALKS,PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY AVERELL HARRIMAN NOTED HOPEFULLY THAT RUSSIA WASBEING MORE PLEASANT IN " THE SMALL THINGS OF LIFE . " AS FOR THE BIGTHINGS, " WE ARE GOING IN GOOD FAITH AND IN THE HOPE OF ACHIEVING SOMESTEPS THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL . " THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES FACING HARRIMANAND HIS FELLOW NEGOTIATOR, BRITISH MINISTER OF SCIENCE VISCOUNTHAILSHAM, IN MOSCOW . . .TEST BAN : KHRUSHCHEV HAS INDICATED THAT HEWOULD REVIVE RUSSIA'S 1961 TERMS FOR A TEST BAN, WHICH INCLUDED AVOLUNTARY MORATORIUM ON UNDERGROUND DETONATIONS, WITHOUT EFFECTIVECONTROLS . THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY THE U.S . AT . THE TIME .THEN, LAST YEAR, RUSSIA OFFEREDTO PERMIT THREE INSPECTIONS OF ITS TERRITORY YEARLY BY WAY OF POLICINGAN UNDERGROUND BAN . MOSCOW SUBSEQUENTLY RENEGED, KHRUSHCHEV NOWINSISTS THAT RUSSIA WILL NEVER " OPEN ITS DOOR TO NATO SPIES, " ANDTHAT " THIS IS NO SUBJECT FOR BARGAINING . " THE WEST WILL NOT ACCEPTAN UNENFORCEABLE MORATORIUM ON UNDERGROUND TESTS, SINCE IT BELIEVESTHAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD BREAK IT AT WILL, AS THEY VIOLATED THEVOLUNTARY TEST BAN IN 1961 . HOWEVER, IF RUSSIA AGREES TO A TREATY THATSIMPLY FORBIDS TESTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH ARE EASILY DETECTABLE THEWEST IS WILLING TO TAKE UP THE PROBLEM OF UNDERGROUND TESTING AT ALATER DATE . .NONAGGRESSION PACT . KHRUSHCHEV DECLARED THAT " AT THECONCLUSION OF A TESTBAN AGREEMENT, " HE WILL REVIVE RUSSIA'S HOARYDEMAND FOR A NONAGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN THE 15 NATO POWERS AND THESATELLITE NATIONS OF THE WARSAW TREATY . IN THE PAST, THIS PROPOSAL HASINVARIABLY BEEN REJECTED BY THE WEST BECAUSE WEST GERMANY AND FRANCEOBJECT THAT IT WOULD IMPLY WESTERN ACCEPTANCE OF A DIVIDED EUROPE ANDRECOGNITION OF EAST GERMANY . IN ANY CASE, THEY POINT OUT, NO SUCHDECLARATION IS NEEDED, FOR NATO'S DEFENSIVE PURPOSES WERE GUARANTEED INITS CHARTER 14 YEARS AGO . THE PROSPECTS . U.S . POLICYMAKERS EMPHASIZETHAT A TEST-BAN TREATY WOULD HAVE LITTLE IF ANY EFFECT ON THE BALANCEOF POWER . SINCE BOTH EAST AND WEST HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH NUCLEARWARHEADS FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE CONFLICT, THE ONLY WAY EITHER SIDE COULDGAIN A DECISIVE STRATEGIC LEAD WOULD BE THROUGH A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH INMISSILE DELIVERY SYSTEMS, WHICH WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE TEST BAN .IN ANY CASE, NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IS NOW SO ADVANCED THAT WEAPONS SUCH ASTHE ANTI-MISSILE MISSILE CAN BE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY IN THE LABORATORY .FURTHERMORE, NO WESTERN STATESMAN BELIEVES THAT A TEST-BAN AGREEMENTWILL RESTRAIN THE FRENCH OR CHINESE FROM TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ATWILL, OR EVEN SLOW THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR ARMS TO OTHER NATIONS . WHY,THEN, IS THE WEST SO EAGER TO SIGN A NUCLEAR PACT WITH RUSSIA ?RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, WASHINGTON HAS COME TO VIEW A TEST-BAN TREATY ASTHE TOUCHSTONE OF SOVIET INTENTIONS . IF THIS ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE CANBE RESOLVED AFTER FIVE YEARS OF FRUSTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENTBELIEVES, THEN THERE IS HOPE THAT EAST AND WEST MAY ULTIMATELY BE ABLETO SETTLE OTHER ISSUES . THOUGH HARRIMAN IS EMPOWERED ONLY TO NEGOTIATEA TEST-BAN AGREEMENT, HE EXPECTS TO " EXPLORE " OTHER COLD WARPROBLEMS, SUCH AS BERLIN AND RUSSIA'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE LAOTIANNEUTRALITY PACT . ON THOSE MATTERS KHRUSHCHEV SO FAR DID NOT APPEAR TOBUDGE . TALKING TO BELGIUM'S FOREIGN MINISTER PAUL-HENRI SPAAK IN KIEVLAST WEEK, KHRUSHCHEV SAID : " BERLIN IS THE FOOT THAT KENNEDY HAS INEUROPE . EVERY TIME I WANT TO, I'LL STAMP ON IT . " IN SHORT, THEEAST-WEST TALKS IN MOSCOW MAY JUST POSSIBLY PROVE NO MORE FRUITFUL THANTHE SINO-SOVIET TALKS . BUT U.S . OBSERVERS STILL WONDER HOW LONGKHRUSHCHEV CAN GO ON FIGHTING A TWOFRONT WAR, REFUSING BOTH CONCESSIONSTO PEKING AND A GENUINE MOVE TOWARD " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " WITH THEWEST .
