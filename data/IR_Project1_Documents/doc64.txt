JAPAN NOOSE OR PNEUMONIA ?, ONE DAY IN 1948, A WELL DRESSEDMIDDLE AGED MAN WALKED INTO A BRANCH OF TOKYO'S TEIKOKU BANKWEARING THE ARMBAND OF A MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL . CLAIMING THAT HE WAS ACITY HEALTH INSPECTOR, THE MAN ORDERED THE BANK MANAGER TO SUMMON ALLHIS EMPLOYEES SO THAT HE COULD GIVE THEM A DOSE OF ANTI-DYSENTERYMEDICINE . THE EMPLOYEES GULPED THE POTION, THEN COLLAPSED IN AGONY .FROM THE OPEN VAULTS, THE MEDICINE MAN GRABBED ABOUT $185 IN CASH ANDDISAPPEARED INTO THE STREET . BEHIND HIM, TWELVE PEOPLE LAY DEAD OFCYANIDE POISONING . THEN BEGAN THE HUNT . FROM WITNESSES, ARTISTS DREWA COMPOSITE PICTURE OF THE ROBBER . EIGHT MONTH AFTER THE ROBBERY,POLICE FINALLY NABBED A PRIME SUSPECT : A 57-YEAR-OLD PROFESSIONALPAINTER NAMED SADAMICHI HIRASAWA . HIRASAWA FIRST ADMITTED HIS GUILT,THEN RETRACTED THE CONFESSION . HE WAS TRIED, CONVICTED, AND SENTENCEDTO HANG . TWO OUT OF 40 . LAST WEEK, EIGHT YEARS AFTER HIS LAST APPEALWAS DENIED, HIRASAWA, NOW 72, WAS STILL IN JAIL UNDER A DEATH SENTENCEJAPANESE ARTISTS, WRITERS AND INTELLECTUALS HAVE RALLIED TO HISSUPPORT AND LAWYERS HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST THE SEVERITY OF THE SENTENCE. " IT SEEMS TO ME, " SAYS ONE FORMER TOKYO MAGISTRATE, " THAT THEEVIDENCE WAS PRETTY FLIMSY . " THE JUDGE MIGHT HAVE A POINT . HIRASAWAINSISTED THAT THE REPUDIATED CONFESSION WAS EXTRACTED FROM HIM BYTORTURE IN A BRUTAL NONSTOP INTERROGATION . LATER, THE PAINTER'S TWOSONS-IN-LAW CLAIMED THAT HE WAS PLAYING CARDS WITH THEM AT THE TIME OFTHE ROBBERY . ONLY TWO OF THE 40 EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME POSITIVELYIDENTIFIED HIRASAWA AS THE ROBBER AND BOTH WERE INCREASINGLY UNSURE ASTHE TRIAL WORE ON . THE ONLY CLUE POINTING TO HIRASAWA WAS THE CALLINGCARD OF THE SUPPOSED HEALTH INSPECTOR, WHICH THE ROBBER HAD LEFT BEHINDIN THE BANK ; HANDWRITING EXPERTS DETERMINED THAT THE WRITING ON THEBACK OF THE CARD WAS HIRASAWA'S . THE PAINTER NEVER DENIED THAT HEONCE HAD THE CARD, BUT CLAIMED THAT IT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM WHENHIS WALLET WAS PICKPOCKETED SHORTLY BEFORE THE ROBBERY . PAINTING INTHE DEATH HOUSE THREE JAPANESE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE UPHELD THEORIGINALVERDICT, BUT THE RAPID TURNOVER OF JUSTICE MINISTERS IN TEN CABINETRESHUFFLES SINCE 1955 HAS HELPED KEEP HIRASAWA ALIVE . " IF THEIRHEARTS WERE IN IT, THEY COULD HAVE READ THE RECORD AND SIGNED THE DEATHWARRANT LONG AGO,  SAYS ONE FORMER JAPANESE JUDGE . BUT THEY WEREAFRAID, AND I WOULD BE, TOO . " HIRASAWA HAS APPLIED FOR A NEW TRIAL,BUT HIS APPLICATION HAS NO LEGAL STAYING FORCE ON THE ORDER OFEXECUTION . TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON HIS CASE, HIRASAWA'S SUPPORTERSARRANGED FOR AN EXHIBITION OF 50  OF THE 480 TEMPERA PAINTINGS THAT HEHAS TURNED OUT IN HIS 15 YEARS IN THE DEATH HOUSE . HIRASAWA'S BACKERSHAVE ALSO CIRCULATED COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL COMPOSITE NEWSPAPER DRAWINGOF THE ROBBER IN HOPES OF TURNING UP NEW SUSPECTS . LAST NOVEMBER STATEOFFICIALS MOVED THE PAINTER FROM TOKYO PRISON TO REMOTE, UNHEATEDMIYAGI DETENTION HOUSE IN NORTHERN JAPAN WHERE ALL JAPANESE EXECUTIONSARE CARRIED OUT . " HE WAS MOVED UP THERE TO DIE, BUT NOT BY HANGING, /SAYS ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS . " THE GOVERNMENT HOPES HE'LL DIE UP THEREFASTER OF NATURAL CAUSES, BECAUSE MIYAGI IS COLD AND UNHEALTHY . THATWAY, THEY CAN KEEP HIS BLOOD OFF THEIR HANDS OFFICIALLY .
