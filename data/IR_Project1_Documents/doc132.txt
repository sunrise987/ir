FRANCE FINIS FOR S.A.O . ? AS SWISSAIR FLIGHT 227 TO ZURICHTAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY AT MUNICH LAST WEEK, IT WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY BYA BLACK POLICE LIMOUSINE . NOT UNTIL THE RED-AND-SILVER CONVAIRDISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT DID THE PLAINCLOTHESMAN INSIDE THE CARRETURN TO HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THAT GEORGES BIDAULT, 63, FORMERPREMIER OF FRANCE AND NOW SELF-STYLED OPERATIONAL CHIEF OF THETERRORIST SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION, HAD LEFT WEST GERMANY . FOR THEFIRST TIME SINCE BIDAULT WAS TRACED TO HIS HIDEAWAY IN A RURAL VILLALAST MONTH, BAVARIA'S MINISTER OF INTERIOR HEINRICH JUNKER BREATHEDEASILY . SIGHED HE : " A HEAVY CROSS IS OFF MY BACK . " BIDAULT DIDNOT LEAVE MUNICH WITHOUT A VOW TO " CONTINUE MY FIGHT AGAINST DE GAULLEUNTIL FREEDOM HAS BEEN RESTORED IN MY COUNTRY . " LANDING IN PORTUGALUNDER AN ASSUMED NAME, HE WAS GIVEN EVEN LESS CHANCE TO PLOT AGAINST DEGAULLE'S LIFE THAN HE ENJOYED IN EASYGOING BAVARIA ; ALMOST AS SOON ASHE TURNED UP AT A LISBON ROOMING HOUSE, SECURITY COPS HAULED HIM OFF TOA SUBURBAN LISBON VILLA . HE WAS EXPECTED TO SEEK REFUGE IN SOUTHAMERICA . DRIFTING AIMLESSLY LIKE A MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY, BIDAULTTODAY IS A PATHETIC FUGITIVE WHO DRINKS TOO MUCH AND TALKS TOO MUCH TOBE AN EFFECTIVE OPPONENT OF THE REGIME . AND FRENCH OFFICIALS INSISTTHAT THE S.A.O . MOVEMENT, WHOSE MURDEROUS FOLLOWERS ONCE STRUCK TERRORINTO THE HEARTS OF FRENCHMEN, HAS FALLEN APART SINCE FRANCE'S TRUCEWITH ALGERIA IN MARCH 1962 . PLAGUED BY APATHY AND HOUNDED BY THE61,000-MAN POLICE FORCE OF INTERIOR MINISTER ROGER FREY, THE S.A.O . ISNO LONGER ABLE TO MAINTAIN COMMANDO UNITS IN EACH OF FRANCE'S NINEMILITARY DISTRICTS, AS IT ONCE DID . TODAY, TOP OFFICIALS CLAIM, THEREARE PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 30 HARDCORE ACTIVISTS LEFT IN THE COUNTRY .WHILE HUNDREDS OF FANATIC ANTI-GAULLISTS HAVE FOUND REFUGE INNEIGHBORING COUNTRIES (500 IN SPAIN ALONE), THEY TOO ARE NOW ALMOST ALLUNDER CLOSE POLICE SURVEILLANCE .
