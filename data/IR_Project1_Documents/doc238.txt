THE UGLYVIOLENCE HAS ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR : ALL THE VICTIMS WERE CHINESE,THAT MINORITY OF 3,000,000 AMONG INDONESIA'S 97 MILLION WHICH BY HARDWORK AND NIMBLE BRAIN HAS EXTRACTED WEALTH FROM THE OVERHEATED,FORESTED ARCHIPELAGO OF PRESIDENT SUKARNO . THE RACIAL BITTERNESS BEATSEVEN BIRMINGHAM, FOR DESPITE REPEATED GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO CRACK THEIRECONOMIC POWER, THE CHINESE SOMETIMES OPERATING THROUGH MIDDLEMEN TOCIRCUMVENT OFFICIAL SANCTIONS STILL CONTROL TRADE, AGRICULTURE, SMALLINDUSTRY, THE BLACK MARKET AND OTHER FORMS OF COMMERCE . " GO INTO EVENTHE SMALLEST VILLAGE IN INDONESIA, " AN INDONESIAN ARMY OFFICER ONCECOMPLAINED, " AND YOU WILL FIND ONE MAN WHOSE HOUSE HAS ELECTRIC LIGHTSAND A REFRIGERATOR . THAT MAN WILL BE CHINESE . " WE ARE HUNGRY . "THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN INDONESIA'S PREJUDICE, SINCE THE OVERSEASCHINESE HAVE BEEN RUNNING THINGS THERE FOR YEARS . BUT FEELING AGAINSTTHE CHINESE HAS RISEN HIGHER AS INDONESIA HAS SLID TOWARD THE BRINK OFECONOMIC RUIN . INFLATION IS OUT OF CONTROL ; BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONHAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST YEAR, AND THE U.S . DOLLAR, OFFICIALLY PEGGEDAT 45 RUPIAHS, NOW GETS 1,500 RUPIAHS ON THE BLACK MARKET .

" HE WENT RIGHT AHEADWITH PLANS TO SQUEEZE OUT WESTERN OIL COMPANIES, THOUGH IN THE PROCESSHE RISKED LOSING THE SOURCE OF ONETHIRD OF HIS NATION'S TOTAL EXPORTEARNINGS . NOT ONE TO BE DISTURBED LONG BY MERE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS,SUKARNO WAS MORE INTERESTED IN TENURE .
