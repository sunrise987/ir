GREAT BRITAIN THE SHOCK OF TODAY (SEE COVER)THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF PROSPERITY ARE EVERYWHERE IN BRITAIN, CROWDINGTHE PAST, COMPLICATING THE PRESENT . ALONG ROLLING ROMAN ROADS ANDWINDING COUNTRY LANES, PAST SLEEPING NORMAN CHURCHES AND WHITEWASHEDFARMS, WEEKEND TRAFFIC FLOWS LIKE AN INVADING ARMY . LONDON'S RAW NEWOFFICE BUILDINGS JOSTLE GEORGIAN MANSIONS ; A HILTON HOTEL STARESIMPERTINENTLY DOWN ONTO BUCKINGHAM PALACE . BOWLING ALLEYS AND DANCEHALLS ARE PACKED EACH NIGHT OF THE WEEK . ON CITY ROOFTOPS, TV ANTENNASSTAND AS THICK AS THE ENGLISH ARCHERS AT AGINCOURT . IN ONE DECADE, THENUMBER OF CARS ON THE ROADS HAS DOUBLED (TO 6,000,000), THOUGH THEENTIRE ISLAND BOASTS ONLY 190 MILES OF EXPRESSWAY . MOST BRITONS EARNTWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DID IN 1949, AND THEY ARE GAMBLING AND BETTINGTHEIR LOLLY AT THE STUPEFYING RATE OF $3 BILLION A YEAR . ONE OFLONDON'S MOST EXQUISITE 18TH CENTURY HOUSES OPENED RECENTLY AS ANOPULENT GAMBLING CLUB . IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BINGO PALACES ANDBETTING SHOPS HAVE MUSHROOMED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHICH SOME NOWCALL " THE WINDFALL STATE . " THESE DAYS, MORE THAN 3,500,000 " INSULAR/ BRITONS GO ABROAD EACH YEAR MOSTLY TO THE CONTINENT, WHERE DARTS ANDMARMALADE AND TEA AT 4 : 30 ARE NOW AN ACCEPTED PART OF THE RITES OFSUMMER . BRITONS ARE BETTER EDUCATED AND IN BETTER HEALTH THAN EVERBEFORE AND NEED PAY NO DOCTORS' BILLS . YET, FOR ALL THEIR HEADY NEWAFFLUENCE, THE BRITISH TODAY FEEL DISTURBED AND INSECURE . THEIRTROUBLED MOOD IS INDEFINABLE BUT INESCAPABLE . IT IS A SENSE OF UNEASEIN WHICH IS BLENDED THE AWARENESS OF NATIONAL DECLINE, THE CONSCIOUSSENSE OF FAILURE TO FIND NEW OUTLETS FOR THEIR ENERGIES, A FEELING THATMANY OF THEIR HALLOWED INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONS ARE INCREASINGLYIRRELEVANT TO A FORMIDABLY CHANGED WORLD . TWO RINGS . THE NATION'SCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, ITS EDUCATION AND ETHICS, WERE ALL DEVELOPED TOMEET THE CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL POWER . ITS HISTORY BOOKS AND LITERATUREREVERBERATE WITH THE NAMES OF SOLDIER-HEROES AND THE BATTLEFIELDS ONWHICH THEY WON AND HELD AN EMPIRE : OMDURMAN AND LUCKNOW, QUEBEC,KHARTOUM, MAFEKING . IN EVERY CORNER OF THEIR ISLAND, STATUES ANDSTREET NAMES STILL CELEBRATE A GLORY THAT HAS PASSED . " YOU USED TOOPEN THE ATLAS, " MUSES A MANCHESTER BUSINESSMAN, " AND HALF THE WORLDWAS RED . NOW BRITAIN IS JUST A LITTLE RED SPECK OFF THE COAST OFEUROPE . " SUEZ CRUELLY DEMONSTRATED TO THE WORLD THAT IT TAKES POWERTO BE A POWER . BUT EVEN THEN, BRITONS COULD NOT COME TO TERMS WITH THEHARSH REALITY OF VANISHED MIGHT . THEIR FEELING OF SHOCK TODAY IS ALLTHE GREATER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO LONG DELAYED . AS IF BY SOMEMALEVOLENT DESIGN, A WHOLE SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS AND FAILURES HASBESET BRITANNIA IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, DEEPENING THE NATION'S ANGST .THE ABRUPT U.S . CANCELLATION OF THE SKYBOLT MISSILE RUDELY EXPOSED THEFACT THAT BRITAIN'S " INDEPENDENT " NUCLEAR DETERRENT IS IN FACT ALMOSTWHOLLY DEPENDENT ON WASHINGTON . THERE WAS A TIME WHEN U.S . PRESIDENTSSOUGHT BRITAIN'S COUNSEL AND EVEN APPROVAL BEFORE TAKING ANY MAJORINITIATIVE IN WORLD AFFAIRS ; IN THE CUBAN CRISIS, THE MOST PERILOUSOF THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE CELEBRATED JACK-MAC TELEPHONE RANG JUSTTWICE . BACK ON THE DOLE . BRITAIN'S INSECURITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY14 LONG MONTHS OF HAGGLING WITH THE EUROPEANS . SWALLOWING THEIR PRIDEAND REVERSING CENTURIESOLD TRADITION, THE BRITISH DECIDED IN MID1961 TOCROSS THE CHANNEL AND MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH THE CONTINENT . THEN LASTWEEK, JUST AS THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF THEIR GOAL, CHARLES DE GAULLEOF FRANCE CONTEMPTUOUSLY CLOSED THE DOOR ON PERFIDIOUS ALBION . EVEN ATHOME, THE STORM SIGNALS WERE FLYING . ONCE AGAIN THE LINES OFUNEMPLOYED WORKERS ARE LENGTHENING OUTSIDE LABOR EXCHANGES . THEHALF-FORGOTTEN WORD " DOLE " IS BACK IN THE LANGUAGE . BRITAIN'SOVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 2.6 PER CENT , THOUGH MILD BY U.S .STANDARDS, IS AT A FOUR-YEAR PEAK AND STILL RISING . MOREOVER, MOST OFTHE 600,000 MEN WITHOUT JOBS ARE CONCENTRATED IN A FEW DOZEN " BLACKSPOTS " IN THE NORTH, WHERE IN SOME COMMUNITIES UP TO 14 PER PER CENTOF THE WORK FORCE IS ON THE DOLE ($13 A WEEK FOR A MARRIED MAN) .GAP NONETHELESS, BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY IS POISED ON A KNIFE EDGE . INTHE PAST DECADE, ITS ECONOMY HAS GROWN ONLY 2FY PER YEAR ON AVERAGE ;IN 1962 IT ROSE ONLY 1 PER CENT , WHEREAS IN THE COMMON MARKET EVEN A 4PER CENT GROWTH RATE IS CONSIDERED DISAPPOINTING . SINCE 1950,BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS CRISES HAVE BROUGHT BRITAIN TO THE BRINK OFBANKRUPTCY SIX TIMES . BY DRACONIAN MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDEDLAST YEAR IN BOOSTING EXPORTS 3 PER CENT FOR A NEW $11 BILLION POSTWARRECORD, HELPING TO MAINTAIN GOLD AND HARD-CURRENCY RESERVES . HOWEVER,IT WAS ONLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY BY CUTTING BACK CREDIT ANDCURBING INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION . " OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD THEIRECONOMIC MIRACLES, " SIGHS A MANCHESTER JOURNALIST . " BRITAIN HAS HADITS CRISES . " BRITAIN NEEDED URGENTLY TO EXPAND ITS MARKETS ANDBROADEN ITS SHAKY FINANCIAL BASE . ONCE INSIDE EUROPE, BRITISH INDUSTRYWAS CONFIDENT THAT IT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST EXPORTS TO THE SIX . ITALSO ANTICIPATED A HEAVY INFLUX OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL FROM U.S . ANDOTHER FOREIGN COMPANIES EAGER TO HAVE A BRITISH TOEHOLD IN THE COMMONMARKET . IF BRITAIN WERE FINALLY EXCLUDED FROM EUROPE, INVESTMENT WOULDCONTINUE TO DWINDLE AND BRITAIN MIGHT BE FORCED AS A RESULT TO MAKEDRASTIC CUTS IN ITS LIVING STANDARDS . MEANWHILE, IT MAY EITHER RETREATBEHIND HIGH TARIFF WALLS OR ELSE RETURN TO ITS CLASSIC IDEAL OF FREETRADE, POSSIBLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE U.S . AND EUROPEAN NATIONSOUTSIDE THE MARKET . THIS WEEK, AS M.P.S FLOCKED BACK TO WESTMINSTERFROM THE CHRISTMAS RECESS, UNEMPLOYMENT THREATENED TO BE AN EVEN MOREEXPLOSIVE ISSUE THAN THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMON MARKET NEGOTIATIONS .THE GOVERNMENT'S BEST ASSET IN TIME OF CRISIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRIMEMINISTER, A POLITICAL MACHOUDINI WHO CAN SLITHER OUT OF ALMOST ANY TRAPBY SHEER SLEIGHT-OF-HAND . UNDISTURBED BY THE COUNTRY'S MOUNTINGFRUSTRATION OVER UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, MACMILLAN DID NOT SWING INTOACTION UNTIL LAST SUMMER, AFTER THE TORIES HAD SUFFERED THE WORSTSERIES OF BY-ELECTION REVERSES INFLICTED ON A BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 40YEARS . IN HIS THIRD AND MOST DRASTIC CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE HE TOOKOFFICE, MACMILLAN PURGED HALF HIS MINISTERS, HANDED KEY POSTS TO SOMEOF THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG POLITICIANS EAST OF THE NEW FRONTIER . TO GINGERUP THE FALTERING ECONOMY, NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALDMAUDLING CUT INTEREST RATES, GAVE GENEROUS NEW TAX CONCESSIONS TOINDUSTRY, SLASHED PURCHASE TAXES ON AUTOS AND A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERGOODS . TO SPEED HOMEBUILDING AND SLUM CLEARANCE A TASK THAT MACMILLANHIMSELF DISCHARGED WITH DISTINCTION IN HIS FIRST CABINET POST IN 1951THE PRIME MINISTER BROUGHT IN SIR KEITH JOSEPH, 45, AN ASTUTEPOLITICIAN AND ONETIME CONSTRUCTION COMPANY EXECUTIVE, AND GAVE HIM THEGO-AHEAD FOR A MAJOR PUBLIC-WORKS PROGRAM . GEOFFREY RIPPON, 38, THEPARTY'S " BACK-ROOM " HOUSING EXPERT, WAS ASSIGNED TO STREAMLINEARCHAIC BUILDING CODES AND TECHNIQUES . TWO WEEKS AGO, AS UNEMPLOYMENTKEPT RISING AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT SLUMPED TO AN ALLTIME LOW(36 PER CENT V . 45 PER CENT FOR LABOR), MACMILLAN ASSIGNED LORDHAILSHAM, HIS MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN, TO MAKE ACRASH EFFORT TO HELP THE WORST DEPRESSED AREAS AS CABINET MINISTERRESPONSIBLE FOR THE NORTHEAST . THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO CALL ANELECTION FOR 21 MONTHS . IT HAS RECENTLY SEEMED LIKELY, HOWEVER, THATMACMILLAN WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMING FALL . BY THEN,POLITICIANS FIGURED, BRITAIN WOULD HAVE MADE HER TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTOTHE COMMON MARKET, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S PUMP PRIMING WOULD HAVE THINNEDTHE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS AND REINVIGORATED THE ECONOMY . BUT AFTER LASTWEEK'S DIMMING OF HOPES FOR A PROMPT ENTRY INTO EUROPE, THE GOVERNMENTMAY FEEL CONSTRAINED TO SEEK A NEW MANDATE EVEN EARLIER . THECONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOR ELEVEN STRAIGHT YEARS, THE LONGESTUNBROKEN INNINGS THAT ANY PARTY HAS ENJOYED SINCE THE 23-YEAR TORYREIGN THAT ENDED IN 1830 . SIXTEEN BY-ELECTION SETBACKS FOR THE TORIESIN THE PAST YEAR HAVE BADLY DENTED MACMILLAN'S PRESTIGE . UNTIL HUGHGAITSKELL'S DEATH LAST WEEK, A TORY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS SEEMEDAT LEAST A POSSIBILITY . AGAINST A DEMORALIZED, LEADERLESS OPPOSITION,THE CONSERVATIVE CHANCES ARE FAR BRIGHTER FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHTELECTORAL VICTORY . SOME EXPERTS SPECULATE THAT HAROLD MACMILLAN MAYDECIDE TO STEP DOWN AFTER THE ELECTION . HE HAS NO CLEAR HEIR, BUTDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . ARAB " ) BUTLER, AN ASTUTE TACTICIAN WHO ISDISTRUSTED BY TORY RIGHTWINGERS, WOULD SUCCEED HIM IF MACMILLAN WEREREMOVED TOMORROW .
