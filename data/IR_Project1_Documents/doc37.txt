TUNISIA PALS NO MORE ONE OF THE MOST PERISHABLE COMMODITIES IN THEARAB WORLD SEEMS TO BE GRATITUDE . WHEN ALGERIA WON INDEPENDENCE FROMFRANCE AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF BLOODY WAR, ITS PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY INDEBTEDTO NEIGHBORING TUNISIA, WHOSE PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, HAD GIVENSHELTER TO 200,000 ALGERIAN REFUGEES AND PROVIDED A REFUGE FOR THETRAINING AND EQUIPMENT OF 18,000 ALGERIAN FIGHTING MEN . BUT LAST WEEK,IN A SHOUTING, GESTICULATING SPEECH IN THE VAST CASBAH SQUARE OF TUNIS,BOURGUIBA SAID IT WAS " SURPRISING " TO DISCOVER THAT ALGERIA HAS "BECOME A RESIDENCE FOR CRIMINALS AND PLOTTERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OFTUNISIA . " HE SEEMED MOSTLY UPSET BY THE FACT THAT ALGERIA HAS REFUSEDTO EXTRADITE ONE BOUBEKER MUSTAFI, A TUNISIAN ACCUSED OF BEING PARTY TOTHE CHRISTMAS ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST BOURGUIBA (TIME, JAN . 4), FORWHICH 13 TUNISIANS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH . BOURGUIBA RIDICULED46-YEAR-OLD ALGERIAN PREMIER AHMED BEN BELLA AS " AN INEXPERIENCED,EXCITED YOUTH, " AND " A SIMPLE-MINDED PEASANT, " BUT CONCEDED THAT "NOT ALL MEMBERS OF THE ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT WERE INVOLVED . " IN ANYCASE, BOASTED BOURGUIBA, " WE HAVE ENOUGH POWER AND STRENGTH TO FACEANY ADVERSARY . I DON'T INTEND TO KEEP UP HYPOCRITICAL RELATIONS WITHANY GOVERNMENT . " AT WEEK'S END BOURGUIBA MADE HIS DISPLEASUREOFFICIAL BY SUMMONING HOME TUNISIA'S AMBASSADOR TO ALGERIA . BUT THEREWAS NO BREAK IN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, NOR ANY SIGN THAT TUNISIA'S10,000-MAN ARMY WAS PREPARING TO TAKE ON ALGERIA'S 120,000 VETERANTROOPS .
