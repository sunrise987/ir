WEST GERMANY SWEET SUCCESS JOVIAL AND POPULAR ECONOMICS MINISTERLUDWIG ERHARD, AFTER YEARS OF PATIENTLY AND IMPATIENTLY WAITING, LASTWEEK FINALLY GOT HIS PARTY'S PROMISE TO MAKE HIM WEST GERMANY'S NEXTCHANCELLOR . EVEN KONRAD ADENAUER HAD TO SAY YES . VICE CHANCELLORSINCE 1957, " UNCLE LUDWIG " WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE NATION'S POSTWARPROSPERITY AND BY FAR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION'S BEST VOTE-GETTER. BUT CHANCELLOR ADENAUER, WHO HATES TO GIVE WAY AFTER 14 YEARS INPOWER, AND HATES EVEN MORE TO GIVE WAY TO ERHARD, THOUGHT HE COULDSTALL OFF ERHARD'S FORMAL APPOINTMENT . AT A PARTY MEETING LAST WEEK,ADENAUER TRIED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HIS SUCCESSOR . GRUMPILY,ADENAUER DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT TOLERATE A CHANCELLOR-DESIGNATE "LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER " IN THE REMAINING MONTHS BEFORE HIS PROMISEDFALL RETIREMENT IS A FACT . BESIDES, HE ADDED, " I SIMPLY DON'T SEE WHYWE MUST REACH A DECISION NOW, " SINCE THERE WERE THREE OTHER CANDIDATESFOR THE JOB, AND HE NAMED THEM : C.D.U . BUNDESTAG LEADER HEINRICH VONBRENTANO ; ADENAUER'S OLD CRONY, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO HEINRICHKRONE ; FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER . THE GAMBIT DID NOT WORK: ONE AFTER THE OTHER, TO THE OLD MAN'S SURPRISE, EACH OF THE THREEPROMINENT LEADERS ROSE TO REFUSE CANDIDACY FOR THE NATION'S MOSTPOWERFUL OFFICE . DER ALTE WAS LICKED, AND TO REPORTERS OUTSIDE, WHOCOMPLAINED ABOUT BEING KEPT AWAY FROM THE MEETING ROOM, HE SNAPPED : "HOW DO YOU THINK I FELT INSIDE THAT ROOM ? I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEENOUTSIDE . " NEXT DAY, WHEN THE C.D.U . PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS MET TOFORMALLY RATIFY THE CHOICE OF ERHARD AS SUCCESSOR, THE 87-YEAR-OLDADENAUER WAS STILL BURNING . " I BEAR NO PERSONAL ANIMOSITY TOWARDPROFESSOR ERHARD, " HE SAID, " BUT MY OPINION IS THAT HE IS NOT ASUITABLE MAN TO BE CHANCELLOR . " THE CAUCUS OVERWHELMINGLY DISAGREED,VOTED 159 TO 47 (WITH 19 ABSTENTIONS) TO NAME ERHARD, 66, THE C.D.U.'SNEXT CHANCELLOR . FOR LUDWIG ERHARD, WHO SAT CHEWING ON A CIGARTHROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS, SUCCESS WAS TOO SWEET FOR ANY THOUGHT OFREVENGE AGAINST HIS OLD FOE . HE PLEDGED " TO FORGIVE AND FORGET "ADENAUER'S INSULTS . ALL EYES THEN SWUNG TO DER ALTE, WHO SWALLOWED HISBITTERNESS, PROMISED TO ABIDE BY THE MAJORITY DECISION . " I AMWILLING, " HE TOLD ERHARD, " TO PASS ALONG TO YOU ALL I KNOW THEINTERESTS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE . " THEN HE ABRUPTLY STOOD UP, SLOWLYAND IMPASSIVELY WALKED THROUGH THE CROWD TO HIS WAITING CAR, AND WITH AWEARY WAVE OF FAREWELL, DROVE HOME .
