UNITED NATIONS MAN AS AN END IN HIMSELF IN THE LOBBIES ANDMEETING HALLS OF THE UNITED NATIONS, U.S . AMBASSADOR ADLAI STEVENSONOFTEN HEARS THE ARGUMENT OF NEW NATIONS THAT DEMOCRACY IS A LUXURY THEYCANNOT AFFORD . STEVENSON CAN MAKE A GOOD CASE TO THE CONTRARY, AS HESHOWED LAST WEEK IN AN ELOQUENT ADDRESS IN MANHATTAN BEFORE THE CENTERFOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS : " THERE IS PRECIOUSLITTLE DIGNITY OR EQUALITY IN OUR NATURAL STATE . MOST HUMAN BEINGSHAVE TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN UTTER VULNERABILITY . ALL ARE BORNUNEQUAL, IN TERMS OF CAPACITY OR STRENGTH . . . AND SURVIVE ONLY THROUGHTHE RESTRAINT SHOWN BY MORE POWERFUL NEIGHBORS . FOR NEARLY 3,000 YEARS/ WESTERN MAN' HAS STRUGGLED TO CREATE A SOCIAL ORDER IN WHICH WEAK,FALLIBLE, OBSTINATE, SILLY, MAGNIFICENT MAN CAN EXERCISE HIS FREE ANDRESPONSIBLE CHOICE . " WHETHER DEMOCRACY CAN PREVAIL IN THE GREATUPHEAVAL OF OUR TIME IS A VALID QUESTION . WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOWHOW CLUMSY, SLOW, INEFFICIENT AND COSTLY IT IS COMPARED TO THECELERITY, CERTAINTY AND SECRECY OF ABSOLUTISM . BUT THE IMPORTANT THINGIS THAT IT HAS SURVIVED . THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT EVEN THEABSOLUTISTS MASQUERADE AS DEMOCRATS ; EVEN THE MILITARY ANDQUASI-MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS STRIVE IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY TO MANAGETHE PUBLIC BUSINESS . AND ALL OF THEM SAY THAT AUTHORITARIANISM IS ONLYA NECESSARY TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY . . . THE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM,WHATEVER THE MAGNIFICENT ENDS THEY PROPOSE THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN, THEKINGDOM OF SAINTS, " FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY, TO EACHACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS' MISS JUST THIS ESSENTIAL POINT : THAT MAN ISGREATER THAN THE SOCIAL PURPOSES TO WHICH HE CAN BE PUT . HE MUST NOTBE KICKED ABOUT EVEN WITH THE MOST HIGH-MINDED OBJECTIVES . HE IS NOT AMEANS OR AN INSTRUMENT . HE IS AN END IN HIMSELF . " THIS IS THEESSENCE OF WHAT WE MEAN BY DEMOCRACY NOT SO MUCH VOTING SYSTEMS ORPARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS OR ECONOMIC OR LEGAL SYSTEMS (THOUGH THEY ALLENTER IN), AS AN IRREVOCABLE AND FINAL DEDICATION TO THE DIGNITY OF MAN.IN THIS SENSE, DEMOCRACY IS PERHAPS MANKIND'S MOST AUDACIOUSEXPERIMENT .
