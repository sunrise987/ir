YEMEN ANOTHER JOB FOR THE U.N . TO THE BLARE OF MILITARYBANDS AND THE SKIRL OF BAGPIPES, A TROOPSHIP LAST WEEK STEAMED INTOEGYPT'S SWELTERING SINAI PORT OF TOR . ABOARD WERE 2,000 EGYPTIANSOLDIERS, THE FIRST BIG CONTINGENT RETURNING FROM THE WAR IN YEMEN .ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF LIEUT . GENERAL ALI AMER HAILED THEM AS "VICTORIOUS TROOPS WHO HAVE ACHIEVED A 20TH CENTURY MIRACLE, " TO WIT :/ SNATCHING THE YEMENI PEOPLE FROM THE PIT OF POVERTY, IGNORANCE ANDDISEASE AND LEADING THEM TOWARD THE PATH OF DIGNITY AND DEVELOPMENT . "DOUBLE TROUBLE . THE RETURN HOME OF EVEN A TOKEN CONTINGENT OFEGYPTIANS WAS ACHIEVED BY THE QUIET DIPLOMACY OF VETERAN U.S . DIPLOMATELLSWORTH BUNKER, 68, WHO LAST YEAR PUT TOGETHER THE DUTCH-INDONESIANSETTLEMENT THAT HANDED WEST IRIAN TO INDONESIA'S SUKARNO . LAST WEEKTHE UNITED NATIONS ANNOUNCED THAT THE PARTIES EMBROILED IN THE YEMENCIVIL WAR HAD ACCEPTED BUNKER'S PROPOSAL FOR A U.N . OBSERVER TEAM WITHA DOUBLE JOB . IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT SAUDI ARABIA ENDS ITS SUPPORT OFTHE ROYALIST TRIBESMEN FIGHTING TO RESTORE IMAM MOHAMMED EL BADR TO THETHRONE HE LOST SEVEN MONTHS AGO, AND ALSO THAT EGYPT'S 28,000-MANEXPEDITIONARY FORCE PULLS OUT AS PROMISED . IN OBTAINING THESETTLEMENT, BUNKER MADE THREE TRIPS TO SAUDI ARABIA AND HELD "EXTENSIVE TALKS " WITH PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER IN CAIRO . GIVINGFORCE TO BUNKER'S ARGUMENTS WAS THE BASIC POLICY DECISION OF THEKENNEDY ADMINISTRATION TO BACK THE PRO-NASSER YEMENI REPUBLICANSAGAINST THE FEUDAL ROYALIST TRIBES . THIS DECISION WAS UNDOUBTEDLYCONVEYED, TACTFULLY, TO SAUDI ARABIA'S PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL BY BUNKER. UNQUESTIONABLY, NASSER WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO HISEXPANSIONIST DRIVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT THE U.S . UNALTERABLYOPPOSES HIS STIRRING UP TROUBLE IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES . UPPERMOST INWASHINGTON'S MIND WAS THE DANGER THAT THE FIGHTING MIGHT SPREAD INTOSAUDI ARABIA, WHERE THE U.S . HAS BIG OIL HOLDINGS . SWITCHEDALLEGIANCE . THE U.N . OBSERVER TEAM, WHICH WILL BE SET UP BY THEFORMER U.N . CONGO COMMANDER, SWEDISH MAJOR GENERAL CARL VON HORN, IS ADEVICE TO SAVE POLITICAL FACE FOR EVERYONE . SAUDI ARABIA HAD ALREADYBEEN CUTTING BACK ON ITS SUPPLY OF MONEY AND GUNS TO THE ROYALISTS,LARGELY BECAUSE EGYPT'S PROJECTED PLAN FOR UNITY WITH SYRIA AND IRAQMADE NASSER FAR TOO FORMIDABLE AN OPPONENT . THE U.N . INTERVENTIONALSO GIVES NASSER A WAY OUT OF THE YEMEN MESS, WHICH HAS TIED UP ATHIRD OF HIS ARMY AT A COST OF $1,000,000 A DAY AND NEARLY 5,000CASUALTIES . ON BALANCE, NASSER EMERGES AS A CLEAR WINNER . THOUGHPROMISING TO REMOVE HIS TROOPS, HE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF LEAVING ANUNSPECIFIED NUMBER FOR THE " TRAINING " OF YEMEN'S REPUBLICAN ARMY .ABOUT THE ONLY GROUP NOT CONSULTED WAS IMAM MOHAMMED AND HIS ROYALISTS,WHOSE GRIP ON YEMEN HAS DWINDLED FROM HALF THE COUNTRY TO THE MOUNTAINSPINE IN CENTRAL YEMEN . SOME 25,000 ARMED SUPPORTERS OF THE IMAM ARESTILL IN ACTION AND STILL DANGEROUS, BUT THEY ARE INCREASINGLYISOLATED, AND SHORT OF FUEL AND WEAPONS . WITH THE ROYALISTS CUT OFFFROM SAUDI SUPPLIES, NASSER MAY WELL BE ABLE GRADUALLY TO CONSOLIDATEHIS GAINS, CUT DOWN ON HIS COMMITMENTS, AND ULTIMATELY COMPLETE HISVICTORY BY ADMITTING REPUBLICAN YEMEN INTO HIS GRANDIOSE SCHEME FOR ANEW UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC .
