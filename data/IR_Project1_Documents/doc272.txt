WHAT A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD BE LIKE IT MAY STILL BEA LONG WAY BACK TO POWER, BUT EVERY BY-ELECTION AND OPINION POLL INBRITAIN TODAY INDICATES THAT A GROWING MAJORITY OF VOTERS WANT A LABORGOVERNMENT . IN A FAR MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY THAN THE WARWEARY NATIONTHAT ELECTED THE LAST LABOR REGIME IN 1945, THE QUESTION IS WHAT LIFEWOULD BE LIKE UNDER NEW SOCIALIST LEADERS . CURIOSITY IS MOST INTENSEAMONG VOTERS UNDER 30, WHO HAVE BEEN SPARED MEMORIES OF THE SNOEK(CANNED MOCK SALMON), " RECONSTITUTED " EGGS AND WHALE STEAK OFPREVIOUS LABORITE AUSTERITY . SENSING THAT THIS NEWYOU-NEVER-HAD-IT-SO-GOOD GENERATION IS BOTH WEARY OF TORY RULE ANDLEARY OF SOCIALIST DOGMA, THE LABOR PROGRAM TODAY EMPHASIZES "PRAGMATISM " AND " RESPONSIBILITY " RATHER THAN HEADLONG PLUNGES INTODOCTRINAIRE EXPERIMENTS . THE PARTY'S CATCHWORDS, A HEADY BLEND OFGLADSTONIAN RHETORIC AND NEW FRONTIER PEP TALK, CALL FOR " A SENSE OFPURPOSE " TO " GET BRITAIN MOVING . " HOW MUCH OF ITS AMBITIOUS PROGRAMWILL ACTUALLY BE ENACTED DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MAJORITY IT CAN WIN ATTHE POLLS . BUT THERE ARE SOME FAIR INDICATIONS OF WHAT LABOR AIMS TODO . NATIONALIZATION STATE OWNERSHIP OF INDUSTRY WHICH WINSTONCHURCHILL CALLED THAT " BURGLAR'S JEMMY TO CRACK THE CAPITALIST CRIB "IS THE GOAL MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SOCIALIST ADMINISTRATION .TORY SCAREMONGERS EVEN CLAIM THAT LABOR ALREADY HAS A " SHOPPING LIST "OF 104 COMPANIES IT PLANS TO NATIONALIZE . HOWEVER, AFTER BITTERARGUMENT THE LABOR PARTY HAS ABANDONED ITS LONGTIME COMMITMENT TOPUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE ECONOMY'S " COMMANDING HEIGHTS . " IT PLANS NOWONLY TO RENATIONALIZE STEEL, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY RESTORED TO PRIVATEENTERPRISE BY THE TORIES, AND BRITAIN'S TRUCKING INDUSTRY . THE ECONOMYA LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD DEMAND BROAD POWERS TO REGULATE THE ECONOMY .IT WOULD GIVE MANUFACTURERS TAX INCENTIVES AND GUARANTEED ORDERS FOREXPORTS, BUT WOULD ITSELF BUILD AND RUN PACESETTING PLANTS IN ANYINDUSTRIES, SUCH AS MACHINE TOOLS, THAT IT JUDGES INADEQUATE ORINEFFICIENT . SOCIALIST PRINCIPLE DEMANDS A TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS, WHICHHAVE BEEN LARGELY IMMUNE SO FAR, AND POSSIBLY EVEN A LEVY ON CAPITAL .IN HAROLD WILSON'S WORDS, BRITAIN HAS A " LAISSEZ-FAIRE, SOFT-CENTER,SPECULATIVE, HIREPURCHASE, ADVERTISER-CONTROLLED, STOP-GO ECONOMY . "TO CHANGE THIS, LABOR WOULD HAVE TO TRANSFORM COMPLETELY THE NATION'SBUSINESS LIFE . HENCE THE ECONOMIST SEES LABOR'S ECONOMIC AIMS AS " ATONCE CONSOLING AND FRIGHTENING . " TO EASE THE NATION'S CRITICAL DEARTHOF LIVING SPACE AND CLEAR ITS SQUALID LEGACY OF SLUMS, LABOR PROMISESTO COMMIT MORE PUBLIC FUNDS TO NEW HOUSING AND REDEVELOPMENT, RESTORERENT CONTROLS, AND REGULATE NEW CONSTRUCTION . LABOR ALSO AIMS TO BREAKTHE AGE-OLD POWER OF WEALTHY LANDOWNERS, WHO SELDOM SELL PROPERTYOUTRIGHT BUT GIVE DEVELOPERS LONG-TERM LEASES ON WHICH THE LANDLORDSCONTINUE TO COLLECT " GROUND RENT . " NEW LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE ALLLEASEHOLDERS THE RIGHT TO BUY ACTUAL " FREEHOLD " OWNERSHIP OF THEIRLAND . EUROPE IN THEORY, THE PROFESSEDLY " INTERNATIONALIST " LABORPARTY OUGHT TO BE FOR BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET, PROBABLYWOULD HAVE BACKED IT HAD LABOR BEEN IN POWER WHEN THE ISSUE AROSE . BUTA LARGE SEGMENT OF LABOR DISTRUSTS CATHOLIC EUROPE AND SUSPECTS THATTHE COMMON MARKET IS A CONSPIRACY TO STRENGTHEN CAPITALISM . BESIDES,MANY ULTRACONSERVATIVE BRITISH TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR FOREIGN COMPETITION. A LABOR ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE WILLING TO REOPEN NEGOTIATIONS FORCOMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP, BUT ITS TOUGHER TERMS WOULD MAKE BRITAIN'SADMISSION MORE DIFFICULT EVEN IF DE GAULLE'S OPPOSITION WERE TODIMINISH . THE U.S . & DEFENSE LABOR WOULD " STAND FIRMLY " BY NATO,AND WOULD HAPPILY LEAVE THE U.S . IN CHARGE OF THE WEST'S NUCLEARDEFENSE AND ABANDON BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT DETERRENT . ADMITTEDLY,BRITAIN WOULD BECOME A SECOND-CLASS MILITARY POWER, BUT WILSONMAINTAINS THAT IT CAN REMAIN " VERY IMPORTANT " IF IT DEVELOPS ITSCONVENTIONAL FORCES . HE CONSIDERS BRITAIN'S PRESENT DEFENSES " MOREINEFFECTIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE ETHELRED THEUNREADY " WHO FAILED TO DETER THE DANES IN 1013 AND PROMISES TO REEQUIPAND REARM BRITAIN'S ARMY OF THE RHINE . WHILE THE PENTAGON, DREADINGNUCLEAR " PROLIFERATION, " IS CHEERED BY LABOR'S WILLINGNESS TORENOUNCE BRITAIN'S DETERRENT, THIS MIGHT STRENGTHEN LABOR'S VOCALNEUTRALISTUNILATERALIST WING . EAST & WEST WILSON PROPOSES REGULARANNUAL SUMMIT MEETINGS OF U.S., BRITISH AND SOVIET HEADS OF STATE ATTHE U.N., SAYS THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS WARMLY RECEIVED WHEN HE VISITEDMOSCOW THIS MONTH . LABOR IS IRREVOCABLY OPPOSED TO GIVING WEST GERMANYNUCLEAR WEAPONS (SO IS THE U.S.) ; IT IS EQUALLY OPPOSED TO ANYARRANGEMENT, SUCH AS THE U.S . PROPOSAL FOR A MULTILATERAL POLARISFORCE, THAT MIGHT ULTIMATELY GIVE GERMANS A FINGER ON THE NUCLEARTRIGGER . THOUGH ANGLOPHILE LUDWIG ERHARD IS TAKING OVER FROMANGLOPHOBE KONRAD ADENAUER, LABOR'S OUTSPOKEN FEAR OF GERMANY IS ASVEHEMENT AS EVER . LABOR FAVORS NUCLEAR-FREE ZONES AND THINNING OUT OFFORCES TO REDUCE TENSION IN CENTRAL EUROPE, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, THEMIDDLE EAST . IN EUROPE, HOWEVER, WILSON INSISTS THAT " DISENGAGEMENTSHOULD NOT BE USED BY EITHER SIDE TO UPSET THE BALANCE OF FORCES . " ONTHE BERLIN QUESTION, LABOR AGREES WITH THE U.S . THAT THE WESTERNGARRISON AND FREE ACCESS TO THE CITY ARE ESSENTIAL . EDUCATION &SCIENCE LABOR SHREWDLY SENSES THAT THE COUNTRY PRESSING NEED IS FOR AGREATLY EXPANDED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BOTH TO ACHIEVE ITS IDEAL OF ACLASSLESS SOCIETY AND TO INCREASE THE FLOW OF TECHNICIANS, SCIENTISTSAND MANAGERS WHO ARE VITAL TO ECONOMIC GROWTH ON THE SCALE ENVISAGED BYLABOR . THE PARTY PROPOSES TO ABOLISH UNIVERSITY FEES, START 45 NEWUNIVERSITIES IN 20 YEARS, AND GREATLY EXPAND EXISTING FACILITIES FORTECHNICAL TRAINING AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH . " POLITICS, " SAYLABORITES, " IS EDUCATION . /
