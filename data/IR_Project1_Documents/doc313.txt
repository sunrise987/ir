FRANCE L'AMOUR FOR LA PATRIE THE PEOPLE OF PARIS CELEBRATEDSUMMER IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY . YOUNG COUPLES WERE LACED TOGETHER UNDERTHE TREES OF THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE, LOCKED LIP-TO-LIP ON THE METROSTAIRS, SNUGGLED FLANK-TO-FLANK ON THE SWIMMING BARGES MOORED ALONG THESEINE . TO THE GAULLISTS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THERE WAS ONLY ONETHING WRONG WITH THIS SURFEIT OF LOVE : IT IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGHBABIES . INTRODUCING NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO CHANGE THAT SITUATION,EX-PREMIER MICHEL DEBRE WARNED : " THERE IS A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATELINK BETWEEN THE WEIGHT OF OUR POPULATION AND OUR FUTURE IN EUROPE ANDTHE WORLD . " NO EXPLOSION . DEBRE COULD HAVE APPEALED TO HISTORY .WHEN NAPOLEON'S ARMIES SWEPT OVER THE CONTINENT 160 YEARS AGO, FRANCECONTAINED ONE-FIFTH OF EUROPE'S POPULATION . TODAY IT REPRESENTSONE-TWENTIETH, AND ONLY IMMIGRATION HAS KEPT FRANCE FROM LOSINGPOPULATION . SINCE 1946, FRANCE'S ANNUAL BIRTH RATE HAS STABILIZED ATBETWEEN 18 AND 19 PER 1,000 PEOPLE . THOUGH WELL BELOW THE U.S . RATEOF 23.4, FRANCE IS NOW ACTUALLY DOING BETTER THAN MOST OF ITS NEIGHBORS. IN WESTERN EUROPE GENERALLY, THE BIRTH RATE HAS SLOWLY BUT STEADILYDECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF POSTWAR UNEASINESSABOUT THE FUTURE, THE SHORTAGE OF NEW HOUSING THAT CONTINUES DESPITETHE ECONOMIC BOOM, AND THE DECISION OF NEWLYWEDS TO SPACE THE ARRIVALOF CHILDREN . THE DECLINE IS EVEN MORE RAPID IN THE COMMUNISTCOUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY POLAND AND YUGOSLAVIA, WHERE THE RATE HAS DROPPEDFROM 28 TO 22 PER 1,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD, PARTLY BECAUSE COMMUNISTGOVERNMENTS SANCTION LEGAL ABORTIONS . THUS, IRONICALLY, WHILE ASIA,AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICAN STILL FEAR THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, EUROPEFEARS THE OPPOSITE . NO DRINKING . FRANCE HAS LONG FOUGHT THE TREND BYOFFERING BONUSES FOR LARGE FAMILIES AND BY SEVERELY OUTLAWING ABORTIONSAS WELL AS FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVICES AND THE SPREAD OF BIRTH CONTROLINFORMATION . TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF AT LEAST THREE CHILDRENPER FAMILY, DEBRE LAST WEEK PROPOSED 1) PRIORITY IN APARTMENTS FORYOUNG COUPLES WITH CHILDREN, 2) TAX EXEMPTIONS TO FAMILIES IN THE YEARTHEY PRODUCE A FOURTH CHILD, 3) A MORE " RECEPTIVE GOVERNMENT ATTITUDETOWARD UNWED MOTHERS . " HE ALSO WANTS FRENCHMEN TO LAY OFF THE BOTTLE,BECAUSE " EACH GENERATION WE LOSE A TOTAL OF 500,000 PERSONS DUE TOOVERINDULGENCE . " OPPOSITION CAME FROM SOCIALIST AND COMMUNISTDEPUTIES WHO ARGUED THAT IT WAS UNREALISTIC TO TALK OF INCREASING THEPOPULATION WHILE FRENCH HOUSING REMAINED IN ITS PRESENT WRETCHED STATE. BUT DEBRE IS STRONGLY BACKED BY PRESIDENT CHARLES DE GAULLE, WHOHOPES THAT FRANCE'S PRESENT POPULATION OF 47 MILLION WILL GROW TO 100MILLION BY THE CENTURY'S END .
