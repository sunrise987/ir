AT ODDS WITH ITS PRINCIPAL EUROPEAN ALLIESAND THREATENED TO IMMERSE CENTRAL AFRICA IN BLOOD . NOW, KATANGA'SREBEL MOISE TSHOMBE SAT WANLY BEHIND A DESK IN A STUCCO COTTAGE IN THECOPPER TOWN OF KOLWEZI AND DECLARED, " I AM READY TO PROCLAIMIMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE WORLD THAT KATANGA'S SECESSION IS ENDED . " THEWORDS OF THE MERCURIAL MOISE HAD A FAMILIAR RING, AND THERE WERESKEPTICS WHO SUGGESTED THE PLEDGE WAS FALSE . " I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN ISEE IT, " SAID ONE DIPLOMAT IN ELISABETHVILLE . " WE KNOW THE MAN, "SHRUGGED CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA IN LEOPOLDVILLE . "IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT TSHOMBE HAS DECLARED HIMSELF READY TORENOUNCE HIS AMBITIONS TO FOUND AN INDEPENDENT STATE . " WISE ACT . "BUT THIS TIME TSHOMBE HAD LITTLE CHOICE . BLUE-HELMETED U.N . TROOPSCONTROLLED NEARLY ALL THE MAJOR RAIL AND POPULATION CENTERS OF KATANGAPROVINCE, AND U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT WAS NOT BACKING DOWN ONHIS THREAT TO CRUSH KATANGA'S WILY SECESSIONIST . UP TO THE LASTMOMENT, TSHOMBE WAVERED . HAVING FLED FROM ELISABETHVILLE " AFRIGHTENED AND DEJECTED MAN, " IN THE WORDS OF BRITISH AND BELGIANOFFICIALS, HE TURNED UP LAST WEEK IN KOLWEZI, WHERE THE LAST 3,000 OFHIS 20,000-MAN GENDARMERIE WERE HOLED UP . A TWO-MAN PEACE MISSIONCOMPOSED OF JACQUES HOUARD, BELGIUM'S CONSUL GENERAL IN SALISBURY,SOUTHERN RHODESIA, AND ANDRE VAN ROEY, DIRECTOR OF KATANGA'S NATIONALBANK, FOLLOWED HIM THERE . FOR 36 DESPERATE HOURS, THE TWO URGED HIM TOYIELD RATHER THAN CARRY OUT HIS THREAT TO BLOW UP THE HUGE DAMS ANDCOPPER AND COBALT MINES OPERATED BY THE GIANT UNION MINIERE COMPANY INKOLWEZI . FINALLY, CONVINCED THAT HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE, TSHOMBE GAVEIN . LATER, APPARENTLY TO SHOW NEWSMEN WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED, HEDROVE THEM TO A MINOR HYDROELECTRIC SUBSTATION 70 MILES OUTSIDEKOLWEZI, AIMED A SIX-POUND ARTILLERY PIECE AT IT AND PULLED THE LANYARD.THE SHOT WAS RIGHT ON TARGET . THE SUBSTATION, APPARENTLY LOADED WITHDYNAMITE, DISINTEGRATED WHILE TSHOMBE GUFFAWED . AS A FINAL ACT OFOBSTREPEROUSNESS HE HAD PEACEMAKER HOUARD THROWN OUT OF KATANGABECAUSE, AS FOREIGN MINISTER EVARISTE KIMBA COMPLAINED, " YOU HAVE DONENOTHING FOR US . " BUT TSHOMBE WAS BEATEN NONETHELESS . EVEN HIS OLDALLY, SIR ROY WELENSKY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE RHODESIAS AND NYASALAND,TOLD HIM HE HAD " ACTED WISELY " IN YIELDING . IS EVERYBODY HAPPY ?THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED MOISE " A GENERAL AND COMPLETE AMNESTY/ FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FOLLOWERS . WITH THAT, TSHOMBE RETURNED TOELISABETHVILLE TO WORK OUT THE PROCEDURES OF HIS CAPITULATION WITH U.N.OFFICIALS . HE FOUND THAT SOME OF THE DETAILS HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKENCARE OF THE BLUE-AND-GOLD FLAG OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT NOW FLUTTEREDOVER THE KATANGESE DEFENSE MINISTRY . SIXTY CIVIL SERVANTS AND 120CONGOLESE ARMY OFFICERS ARRIVED FROM LEOPOLDVILLE TO TAKE OVERKATANGA'S MILITARY REMNANTS AND ADMINISTER POSTAL SERVICE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION . AS RESIDENT MINISTER,LEOPOLDVILLE'S TOP MAN IN KATANGA WOULD BE SLIGHT, SOBER JOSEPH ILEO,40, A MODERATE WHO SERVED AS INTERIM PREMIER OF THE CONGO AFTER ERRATICPATRICE LUMUMBA WAS DEPOSED IN 1960 . THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHETHERLEOPOLDVILLE'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT COULD KEEP KATANGA UNDER CONTROL NOWTHAT IT WAS WON . IF THE MOB VIOLENCE BACK IN LEO ITSELF WAS ANYINDICATION, U.N . TROOPS WOULD HAVE TO STAY ON IN KATANGA FOR QUITE AWHILE . DOWN LEO'S BOULEVARD ALBERT STORMED 600 STUDENTS AND STREETURCHINS, SHOUTING " TSHOMBE TO THE GALLOWS ! " AT THE BRITISHEMBASSY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED FAIR GAME BECAUSE OF LONDON'S FRIENDLYPOLICY TOWARD KATANGA, THE MOB BATTERED DOWN THE DOORS, SACKED THEOFFICES, AND TRIED TO PRY OFF A COAT OF ARMS BECAUSE, AS ONE STUDENTCRIED, " IT'S MADE OF KATANGA COPPER .! " AFTER AN HOUR, THE U.N.'SCONGO CHIEF ROBERT GARDINER ARRIVED AND SCATTERED THE MOB . ALL THEWHILE, A JEEPLOAD OF ADOULA'S COPS SAT CHUCKLING NEAR BY, MAKING NOMOVE TO STOP PILLAGE .
