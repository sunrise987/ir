RED CHINA THE SELF-BOUND GULLIVER(SEE COVER) " COMMUNISM IS NOT LOVE ! " CRIED MAO TSE-TUNG . "COMMUNISM IS A HAMMER WE USE TO DESTROY OUR ENEMIES ! " MAO, THESOMEWHAT ENIGMATIC RULER OF RED CHINA, HAS CERTAINLY BEEN FLAILING INALL DIRECTIONS WITH HIS HAMMER OF LATE, BUT NOTHING MUCH HAS BEENDESTROYED . EVEN NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, MAO'S MOST RECENT TARGET, HASEMERGED UNSCATHED FROM PEKING'S INCESSANT BLOWS . THE ONLY THING MAOHAS DONE WITH HIS PAPER HAMMER IS TO FAN NEW HATREDS FOR HIMSELF ANDHIS RED REGIME . TINY ALLIES . NOT TOO LONG AGO, RED CHINA HAD FRIENDSGALORE . MANY OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS OF ASIA, AND COLONIALPEOPLES EVERYWHERE, LISTENED ADMIRINGLY TO MAO'S BOASTFUL PLANS OF ASWIFT TRANSITION FROM POVERTY TO PLENTY . THE LEFT WING IN WESTERNEUROPE AND THE U.S., DISENCHANTED WITH STALIN'S TERROR, SAW MAO AS ANEW AND NOBLER ARCHITECT OF A PEOPLES' SOCIALISM . IN THE UNITEDNATIONS, IT SEEMED ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE RAMBUNCTIOUS AFRO-ASIANVOTES OVERCAME U.S . RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF TAKING CHINA'S SEAT AWAYFROM THE NATIONALISTS ON FORMOSA AND GIVING IT TO THE COMMUNIST REGIME. BUT MAO FINDS LITTLE SYMPATHY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY . HE HASEMBROILED HIS HARD-PRESSED COUNTRY IN SIMULTANEOUS FEUDS WITH THE U.S.,THE SOVIET UNION AND INDIA, THE THREE MOST POPULOUS NATIONS IN THEWORLD AFTER HIS OWN . IN FACT, HE HAS PLUNGED CHINA INTO AN ISOLATIONSO COMPLETE THAT HE CAN COUNT AS CERTAIN ALLIES ONLY TINY NORTH KOREAIN ASIA AND EVEN TINIER ALBANIA IN EUROPE .IT SEEMS LIKE SHEERLUNACY FOR MAO TO CHALLENGE THE TWO GREATEST POWERS ON EARTH AT A TIMEWHEN CHINA'S INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE ARE STILL STAGGERING FROM THEDISASTERS OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND BEFORE HE HAS THE ARMAMENTS TOENGAGE IN ANY LARGE-SCALE CONTEST . BUT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THATMAO MAY HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK CHINA'S ECONOMICFETTERS, AND STILL ABIDE BY HIS HARSH IDEOLOGICAL TENETS, LIES IN ADRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ORDER . TO THAT END HEHAS EMPHASIZED BOTH RACE AND COLOR IN HIS ATTEMPT TO WIN FRIENDS ANDALLIANCES . RED CHINA HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF ONE DAY EMPLOYINGINDONESIA'S OIL, THAILAND'S RICE, EVEN JAPAN'S TECHNOLOGY, AS FUEL FORA HUGE ASIAN ALLIANCE THAT COULD SAFELY DEFY THE WEST . AND NOW MAO HASBEEN EMPHASIZING COLOR AS A WAY TO ALIGN THE HAVE-NOT NATIONS OF ASIAAND AFRICA AGAINST THE WEST .PANDAS & TIGERS . IT WOULD SEEM OBVIOUS THAT MAOTSE-TUNG HAS ENOUGH TROUBLE AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING FOR IT ABROAD . THEGREAT LEAP FORWARD, LAUNCHED WITH SUCH FANFARE IN 1958, WAS INTENDED TOBRING QUICK SUCCESS IN 1) BUILDING A PURE COMMUNIST STATE, AND 2)MAKING CHINA OVER INTO A FIRST-CLASS WORLD POWER . INSTEAD, THE LEAP'SFRENZIED MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS INTO COMMUNES, THE SETTING UP OFBACKYARD BLAST FURNACES, AND THE 24-HOUR-A-DAY SPEEDUP IN THE FACTORIESNEARLY WRECKED THE NATION . TODAY, CHINA'S AGING RED LEADERSHIP(AVERAGE AGE : 63) KNOWS THAT IT WILL NEVER SEE THE PROMISED LAND, ANDTHAT CHINA MUST LABOR ON FOR AT LEAST A QUARTER CENTURY PERHAPS MUCHLONGER BEFORE ACCOMPLISHING THE SECOND GOAL . WHAT MANNER OF COUNTRYAND WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE MUST THE COMMUNISTS DEAL WITH IN TRYING TOACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION ? CHINA, OF COURSE, IS ENORMOUS 14 TIMES THESIZE OF TEXAS . IT EXTENDS 2,400 MILES FROM THE BANKS OF THE AMUR RIVERIN TOPMOST MANCHURIA TO THE TROPICAL JUNGLE BORDER WITH VIET NAM, AND2,500 MILES ACROSS FROM THE INDENTED COAST ON THE CHINA SEA TO THEKUNLUN MOUNTAINS DEEP IN CENTRAL ASIA . INSIDE THIS VAST DOMAIN LIESJUST ABOUT EVERY VARIETY OF FLORA AND FAUNA IMAGINABLE, FROM ROLLICKINGPANDAS TO PROWLING TIGERS, FROM THE INVIGORATING GINSENG ROOT TO GROVESOF THIN NANMU TREES . TO ITS PEOPLE, CHINA SIMPLY MEANS " HERE . "SINCE THE DAYS OF PREHISTORY, CHINA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A WORLD INITSELF, SEPARATED FROM OUTSIDE BARBARIANS BY THE MOST PERFECT OFPHYSICAL BARRIERS . ON THE EAST AND SOUTH IS THE PACIFIC, THE LARGESTOF OCEANS . TO THE WEST RISES THE HIGHEST PLATEAU ON EARTH . IN THENORTH STRETCH THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DESERT ; AND HERE, TO PREVENTREPEATED INCURSIONS OF HARD-RIDING NOMADS . CHINESE EMPERORS BUILT THE1,500-MILE GREAT WALL . REBELLION'S HOME . THOUGH UNITED BY AN ANCIENTCULTURE, CHINA HAS NEVER BEEN AS MONOLITHIC AS IT LOOKS . AN EASTWESTLINE DRAWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE VALLEYS OF THE YANGTZE ANDYELLOW RIVERS DIVIDES NORTH FROM SOUTH CHINA . NORTH OF THE LINE,SUMMERS ARE SHORT AND HOT, WINTERS LONG AND BITTERLY COLD, AND THEPRINCIPAL CROPS ARE WHEAT AND MILLET . THE MEN OF NORTH CHINA ARE OFTENAS TALL AS AMERICANS, RELATIVELY PLACID, CEREMONIAL AND SAY THESOUTHERNERS SLOW-THINKING . SOUTH OF THE LINE, THE CLIMATE IS HOT ANDHUMID, AND THE PRINCIPAL CROP IS RICE . BROKEN UP INTO VALLEYS ANDSMALL PLAINS BY INNUMERABLE MOUNTAIN RANGES, THE SOUTH IS THE HOME OFINDIVIDUALISM, ANARCHY AND MYSTICAL INTROSPECTION . THE SHORTSTATUREDSOUTHERNERS SPEAK A MULTITUDE OF DIALECTS, ARE COMMERCIALLYENTERPRISING AND PERENNIALLY REBELLIOUS ALMOST EVERY CHINESE REVOLUTIONHAS ORIGINATED IN THE SOUTH . PRACTICALLY ALL CHINESE CITIZENS OF THEU.S . CAME ORIGINALLY FROM A SMALL SOUTH CHINA AREA NEAR CANTON CALLEDTOISHAN, WHICH IS TODAY, CURIOUSLY ENOUGH, KNOWN IN CHINA AS " THE HOMEOF VOLLEYBALL . /NATION'S BIRTHPLACE . CHINA'S 22 PROVINCES BAFFLEFOREIGNERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM SOUND ALIKE (HONAN, HUNAN ;KIANGSU, KIANGSI NSI, SHENSI) . MOST TYPICAL OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCESIS PERHAPS HOPEH, WHICH CONTAINS THE CAPITAL CITY OF PEKING . FROM ITSRUGGED BORDER WITH MANCHURIA, THE PROVINCE RUNS DOWN IN A SHELVINGPLAIN TO THE SHALLOW GULF OF CHIHLI . VERY FEW EMINENT COMMUNISTS COMEFROM HOPEH OR ITS NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF SHANSI, WHICH IS NOTED FORSACRED MOUNTAINS AND SUCH SPECTACULAR CAVE TEMPLES AS YUN KANG, WHERE AMILE-LONG CLIFF FACE HAS BEEN CHISELED INTO THOUSANDS OF BUDDHISTIMAGES . SHENSI IS REVERENCED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE CHINESE NATION,AND WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FIRST UNIFIED BY THE CH'IN DYNASTY IN 221B.C., ITS CAPITAL WAS NEAR PRESENT-DAY SIAN . SOUTH CHINA IS A MUCHLARGER AND MORE VARIED REGION THAN THE NORTH . THE PEOPLE OF KIANGSIARE THE SCOTS OF CHINA AND ARE SAID TO BE CLANNISH, STINGY ANDQUARRELSOME . THEY HAVE HAD LONG EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNISM AND,PRESUMABLY, FEW ILLUSIONS, SINCE THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC WASESTABLISHED THERE IN 1931 AND HELD OUT AGAINST THE NATIONALISTS UNTIL1934, WHEN MAO LED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS TROOPS ON THE 8,000-MILE LONGMARCH TO YENAN IN THE NORTH . KIANGSI'S SOUND-ALIKE NEIGHBOR, KIANGSU,HAD A REPUTATION FOR VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND EASY LIVING . THE KIANGSU CITYOF SOOCHOW WAS THE SYBARIS OF OLD CHINA, AND PROSTITUTES IN ALL PARTSOF THE COUNTRY TRIED TO IMITATE THE SOFT SOOCHOW DIALECT WITH ITSMUSICAL, ROUNDED VOWELS . LAND OF LEADERS . THE FRUIT-RICH PROVINCE OFSHANTUNG, HOME OF CONFUCIUS AND HIS FELLOW SAGE MENCIUS, IS INHABITEDBY A STURDY PEASANTRY THAT SPEAKS A MANDARIN DIALECT SO HARSH ANDUNMELODIC THAT CHINESE SAY, " BETTER TO QUARREL WITH A MAN FROM SOOCHOWTHAN TO CONVERSE CIVILLY WITH A SHANTUNGESE . " BEAUTIFUL SZECHWANBOASTS THAT IT GROWS ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED FIVE PROVINCES, AND IT ISFILLED WITH TERRACED HILLS, RIVERS, COAL AND VALUABLE MINERALS . ANHWEICONTAINS THE SUGAR-LOAF MOUNTAINS AND PINNACLED ROCKS MADE FAMOUS BYTHE MISTY PAINTINGS OF CHINESE ARTISTS . TO THE COMMUNISTS, THE THREEMOST IMPORTANT PROVINCES ARE THE SOUTHERN STATES OF HUNAN, CHEKIANG ANDKWANGTUNG, WHICH PRODUCED MOST OF TODAY'S RED LEADERS. MAO TSE-TUNGWAS BORN NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF CHANGSHA, AS WAS HIS NO . 2 MAN, LIUSHAO-CHI . OTHER RED HUNANESE : LABOR BOSS LI LI-SAN, ARMY COMMANDERSPENG TEH-HUAI AND LO JUNG-HUAN . KWANGTUNG, WITH ITS CAPITAL CITY OFCANTON, IS THE NERVE CENTER OF SOUTH CHINA . ITS MEN HAVE A REPUTATIONFOR PUGNACITY AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, ITS WOMEN FOR SLIM, ALMONDEYEDBEAUTY . WAY OUT WEST . BEYOND CHINA PROPER EXTEND VAST TERRITORIESTHAT WERE CONQUERED CENTURIES AGO BUT OFTEN LIGHTLY HELD BY THE CHINESE. THE BROAD PLAINS OF MANCHURIA HAVE BECOME THE THREE PROVINCES OFKIRIN, HEILUNGKIANG, AND LIAONING . SHENYANG, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MUKDEN,IS THE PITTSBURGH OF CHINA, AND ITS STEEL MILLS ARE WITHIN SIGHT OF THEFELT-COVERED TENTS OF MANCHU HERDSMEN, WHO ARE NOW OUTNUMBERED ABOUT 30TO 1 BY CHINESE IMMIGRANTS .AS WELL AS MOST OF GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S UNSEATED KUOMINTANGCHIEFS .AT INNER MONGOLIA BEGINS CHINA'S FAR WEST, WHICHALMOST EXACTLY RESEMBLES THAT OF THE U.S . PRAIRIE, DESERT AND TOWERINGMOUNTAINS AND IS INHABITED BY THE CHINESE EQUIVALENT OF AMERICANINDIANS, THE UIGHUR, KAZAKH AND KHIRGHIZ TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE DISTINCT INRACE AND RELIGION (MOSLEM) FROM THEIR OVERLORDS . THE TRIBESMEN HAVEREPEATEDLY REBELLED AGAINST ALL CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS AND MAKE NOEXCEPTION OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME . LEAP'S LOSS . NO ONE CAN SAY WITHACCURACY HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN CHINA'S BORDERS . THE COMMUNISTS'1953 CENSUS SAID 582 MILLION . THE CHINESE NATIONALISTS ARGUE THAT THISFIGURE WAS TOO HIGH ; IN FACT, SAYS THE U.S . CENSUS BUREAU, IT WASFAR TOO LOW, AND VIRTUALLY ALL WESTERN EXPERTS AGREE . IN ANY CASE, THEU.S . STATE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT CHINA'S POPULATION IN JUNE OF THISYEAR WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 720 MILLION . THIS LAND ANDTHIS PEOPLE HAVE NOW LIVED FOR 14 YEARS UNDER THE RULE OF THECOMMUNISTS . THE GAINS HAVE BEEN CONVULSIVE : SCHOOLS BUILT AT THESAME FRENZIED PACE AS TRACTOR PLANTS ; HOSPITALS RUSHED UP INPROVINCES THAT HAD SCARCELY EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR ; ROADS AND RAILWAYSTHROWN OVER GORGES, THROUGH MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS DESERTS . THE PACE WASSO FAST AND FRENZIED THAT IT RESULTED IN MISMANAGEMENT ANDADMINISTRATIVE LUNACY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS HAVE LOST CHINAA GOOD FIVE YEARS IN ITS REBUILDING, AND THE NATION IS NOW ESTIMATED TOBE JUST ABOUT WHERE IT WAS IN 1957 IN INDUSTRY AND CROP PRODUCTION .EVEN IN 1957, SUPPLIES WERE JUST BARELY SUFFICIENT FOR NEEDS, AND SINCETHAT TIME, AT LEAST 70 MILLION MORE CHINESE HAVE BEEN BORN AND MUST BEFED, CLOTHED, HOUSED AND EDUCATED . PEKING HAS DUG INTO ITS SLENDERCASH RESERVES TO BUY WHEAT FROM ABROAD AT A TOTAL COST OF $782 MILLION. THE QUARREL WITH RUSSIA HAS BEENEQUALLY DAMAGING . WHEN SOVIET ENGINEERS ANDTECHNICIANS WERE ABRUPTLY CALLED HOME IN 1960, THEY NOT ONLY LEFT MANYCONSTRUCTION JOBS INCOMPLETE BUT ALSO TOOK THEIR BLUEPRINTS WITH THEM .PEKING FINDS SPARE PARTS FOR SOVIET EQUIPMENT HARD TO GET, AND MUSTCANNIBALIZE SOME MACHINES TO KEEP OTHERS WORKING . MANY FACTORIES ARENOW DEVOTED TO MAKING SPARE PARTS INSTEAD OF NEW ITEMS . HEAVY INDUSTRYHAS HAD TO GIVE WAY TO LIGHT, AND AT LEAST TWO PLANTS FORMERLY MAKINGRAILROAD CARS ARE NOW TURNING OUT RUBBER-TIRED HANDCARTS ANDWHEELBARROWS . IRON MONUMENTS . AGRICULTURE IS CHINA'S JUGULAR VEIN,AND THE YEAR'S CRITICAL PERIOD IS THE WINTER CROP HARVEST, WHICH TAKESPLACE IN SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER . CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT THISYEAR'S CROP WILL FLUCTUATE AROUND THE 180-185 MILLION TONS OF GRAINACHIEVED LAST YEAR A GOOD BUT NOT A SENSATIONALLY GREAT HARVEST YEAR .THE COMMUNES OF THE GREAT LEAP EXIST NO LONGEREXCEPT ON PAPER, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE IS DOTTED WITH RUSTING PILLARS OFPIG IRON, MELANCHOLY MEMORIALS OF THE BACKYARD FURNACES THAT MAOTHOUGHT WOULD REVITALIZE CHINA . THE TYPICAL FARM UNIT NOW IS APRODUCTION TEAM OF 25 TO 40 FAMILIES, WHICH ARE GIVEN CONSIDERABLEAUTONOMY IN DECIDING WHAT AND WHEN TO PLANT . PRIVATE PLOTS WERERETURNED TO THE PEASANTS IN 1961, AND ARE PRODUCING WELL FOR THE FREEMARKET . AS USUAL, THE COMMUNISTS KEEP CLOSE WATCH : THE STICK COMESDOWN IN THE FORM OF CLOSE REGULATION OF THE FREE MARKET, AND THE CARROTIS DANGLED IN THE GUARANTEES OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR CROPS SOLDTO THE STATE OVER AND ABOVE THE COMPULSORY DELIVERIES . IN THE PAST ANDIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, EVERY HARVEST BECOMES A TIME OF NATIONALBREATH HOLDING . IN A BORDERLINE ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF CHINA, ANYIMPROVEMENT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT, AND SO IS EVERY DECLINE . DOUBLESELVES . BUT WHAT MOST THREATENS THE REGIME IS THE SQUANDERED RESERVESOF GOOD WILL AMONG MILLIONS OF CHINESE WHO HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THECOMMUNISTS' DISPLAY OF STRENGTH, INCORRUPTIBILITY AND IRON DISCIPLINE .MORE THAN BY PHYSICAL LABOR, THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN WORN OUT BY MASSBRAIN-WASHING SESSIONS, PUBLIC-ACCUSATION MEETINGS, COLLECTIVECONFESSIONS, AND ENDLESS " STRUGGLE " CONFERENCES IN WHICH RELAYS OFREDS UPBRAID BACKSLIDERS . AS A RESULT, HARRIED CITIZENS DEVELOP WHATONE EXPERT CALLS " DOUBLE SELVES, AN OUTER, SUPERFICIAL SELF THATCONFORMS TO COMMUNIST DEMANDS, AND AN INNER, MORAL SELF THAT REMAINSHIDDEN . " BUT IN GENERAL, RIGID DISCIPLINE FELL AWAY WITH THE COLLAPSEOF THE GREAT LEAP, AND FOOD RATIONS WERE INCREASED TO APPEASE A RESTIVECITIZENRY . MORE RECENTLY, A NEW CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN INSTITUTED TO STAMPOUT APATHY . IT IS A MORE SOPHISTICATED PROJECT . THESE DAYS NO ONEURGES THE CITIZENRY TO COLLECT FLIES IN MATCHBOXES ; THE CRY IS :FIGHT WASTE, FIGHT CORRUPTION, FIGHT PRIVILEGE . NICE TO MOTHERS . SOMEOF THE TRAPPINGS OF THE NEW PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ARE WEIRD . IN RECENTMONTHS, NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HAVE REJOICED OVER THE BEHAVIOR OF THE/ GOOD 8TH COMPANY ON NANKING ROAD, " AN ARMY DETACHMENT ON GARRISONDUTY IN THE HEART OF WICKED SHANGHAI . THESE HEROES HAVE PRESERVEDTHEIR COMMUNIST PURITY FOR 14 LONG YEARS IN THE FACE OF INNUMERABLETEMPTATIONS BY BOURGEOIS CAPITALIST DEVILS . WHEN " PROFESSIONALLOAFERS " TRIED TO BRIBE THEM WITH WADS OF BANKNOTES, THE MONEY WASSPURNED ; WHEN " OVERDRESSED WOMEN ACCOSTED THEM ON THE STREET, THESOLDIERS ORDERED THEM AWAY . " ONE SOLDIER FOUND A PENNY AND PROMPTLYTURNED IT OVER TO THE COMPANY'S POLITICAL INSTRUCTOR, WHO EXPLAINED TOTHE OTHERS : " ONE CENT IS ALMOST NOTHING, BUT IF HE HAD KEPT IT, HEWOULD HAVE A SHADY SPOT IN HIS HEART . /EVEN MORE EDIFYING IS THE CASE OF 22-YEAR-OLD LEI FENG,A SQUAD LEADER IN AN ARMY TRANSPORT COMPANY STATIONED IN MANCHURIA . INTHE BAD OLD DAYS, HIS FATHER WAS BURIED ALIVE BY THE JAPANESE, HIS TWOBROTHERS STARVED TO DEATH, AND HIS MOTHER HANGED HERSELF AFTER BEINGRAPED BY A LANDLORD . IN THE GOOD NEW DAYS, LEI FENG WAS ALWAYS HELPINGOLD LADIES ACROSS STREETS, BUYING RAILWAY TICKETS FOR MOTHERS WHO HADLOST THEIRS, RUSHING OUT TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK ON DIKES AND CANALS, ANDDIGGING WITH HIS FINGERS WHEN HIS SHOVEL BROKE . LEI FENG DIED LASTYEAR IN AN ACCIDENT BUT, FORTUNATELY FOR THE PROPAGANDISTS, LEFT BEHINDA 200,000-WORD DIARY FILLED WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS " I THINK MYPURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO WORK FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR OTHERS, " AND, " I AMALL FOR THE PARTY, SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM . " HAILED AS THE IDEALCOMMUNIST, LEI FENG IS INTENDED TO BE THE MODEL FOR CHINESE YOUTH WHOHAVE TROUBLE IDENTIFYING WITH THE GRIZZLED VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCHAND THE CIVIL WAR . IN THE PAST YEAR, AT LEAST 40 BOOKS HAVE BEENWRITTEN ABOUT LEI FENG, AND 1,000 STORYTELLERS ROAM THE VILLAGESENTHRALLING ILLITERATE PEASANTS WITH HIS EXPLOITS AND HIS LOVE OF MAO .COLLECTING COUPONS . BUT IF LEI FENG REPRESENTS THE MYTHICAL YOUNGCHINESE, WHAT IS THE REALITY LIKE .? ONE ANSWER CAME LAST WEEK FROM AU.S . TURNCOAT, BELGIAN-BORN ALBERT BELHOMME, A FORMER G.I . WHO HADDEFECTED TO CHINA AFTER THE KOREAN WAR . AFTER TEN YEARS IN CHINA,BELHOMME AND TWO OTHER U.S . DEFECTORS, LOWELL SKINNER AND SCOTT RUSH,BECAME POLITICALLY DISILLUSIONED AND WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. BELHOMME SAYS THE AVERAGE WAGE AT THE PAPER FACTORY IN TSINAN WHEREHE WAS EMPLOYED WAS ABOUT $18 A MONTH . SINGLE WORKERS LIVED INDORMITORIES WITH FOUR BUNKS TO A ROOM, FAMILIES IN ONEROOM APARTMENTSIN BLOCKS OF BRICK FLATS . DURING LUNCH BREAKS AT THE FACTORY, BELHOMMERECALLS, WORKERS " TALKED MOSTLY ABOUT FOOD, HOW TO GET FOOD, ANDPRICES . " WHEN AN OFFICE WORKER REFERRED TO THE COMMUNIST CADRES AS "GOLDEN BOYS, " HIS REWARD WAS A TRIP TO A " LABOR-EDUCATION CAMP, " ANDTHEN TO JAIL . ON HIS RETURN TO THE FACTORY, HE WAS RE-EMPLOYED, BUT ASA COMMON LABORER . IN CHINA TODAY, FOOD IS PLENTIFUL IN SOME AREAS,SCARCE IN OTHERS . SO IT IS WITH ITEMS SUCH AS CLOTH . LAST YEAR, WHENTHE CLOTH RATION IN CANTON WAS ONLY 1F FEET PER PERSON ANNUALLY, IT WAS7 FEET IN TSINAN . TO BUY COMMODITIES, WORKERS NEEDED COUPONS AS WELLAS MONEY : ONE COUPON, PLUS THE NECESSARY CASH PRICE, GOT A SMALLCOOKING POT . EACH CITIZEN ALSO RECEIVED A TICKET FOR TWO BARS OFTOILET SOAP A YEAR, AND ONE OF LAUNDRY SOAP PER MONTH, AND THERE WERERATION CARDS FOR COOKING OIL, FLOUR, SUGAR AND SWEETS . THE MEAT RATIONIN TSINAN IS CURRENTLY THREE OUNCES A MONTH, AND GRAIN IS 37 POUNDS FORMEN DOING " MEDIUM-HEAVY " WORK . (MOST TOWNS ALSO HAVE FREE MARKETS,AT WHICH FOOD IS AVAILABLE OFF RATION AT HIGH PRICES.) SAYS BELHOMME :/ PEOPLE ARE NOT HUNGRY TODAY, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT FULL . /THE GRIMNESS AND SCARCITY OF LIFE IN CHINA ISSOMETIMES BRIGHTENED BY EXPLOITS TESTIFYING TO THE INGENUITY AND DOGGEDWORK OF ITS CITIZENS . CANADA'S DR . WILDER PENFIELD, ONE OF THEWORLD'S TOP NEUROSURGEONS, RETURNED LAST WEEK FROM RED CHINA AND TOLDOF A UNIVERSITY OF SHANGHAI MEDICAL TEAM THAT BUILT A HEART-LUNGMACHINE FROM SCRATCH IN 18 MONTHS . WHEN THEY TESTED IT WITH DOGS, THEANIMALS DIED OF AIR BUBBLES IN THE HEART . THE CHINESE WENT BACK TOWORK, GUIDED ONLY BY ARTICLES IN MEDICAL JOURNALS, AND THREE YEARSLATER CAME UP WITH A FAR BETTER MACHINE WHICH HAS NOW BEEN USED IN 60SUCCESSFUL OPENHEART SURGICAL CASES . PLANNED BLESSINGS . CHINA'SFUTURE DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE PILLARS OF THE PARTY : THE ARMY ANDTHE STUDENTS . FROM ALL THREE MUST COME THE SKILLS AND DEDICATIONNEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE STAGGERING PROBLEMS POSED BY OVERPOPULATION ANDUNDERPRODUCTION . AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID IS CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG,WHOM THE PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES TO BE OMNIPOTENT AND INCAPABLE OF MISTAKES. THE PEOPLE ARE ENDLESSLY TOLD THAT MAO IS THE SUN, THE LODESTAR, THELIVING BUDDHA, AND HE IS SAID TO BE FAR GREATER " THAN THE EMPTY,HYPOCRITICAL AND NEGATIVE JESUS CHRIST . " PEASANTS ARE TAUGHT TO SING: THE SUN IS RISING IN THE EAST . CHINA HAS BROUGHT FORTH A MAOTSETUNG . HE PLANS BLESSINGS FOR THE PEOPLE . AIYAYAO, HE IS THEPEOPLES' GREAT SAVIOR ! WHATEVER THE PROPAGANDA, MAO HAS WORKED FORMORE THAN 30 YEARS WITH THE OTHER SIX MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEEOF THE 19-MAN POLITBURO WITHOUT AN INTERNAL BLOODBATH A RECORDUNMATCHED BY ANY OTHER MODERN TYRANNY, COMMUNIST OR FASCIST . AMONGTHIS BAND OF BROTHERS, DISSENT IS POSSIBLE YOU MAY LOSE YOUR JOB BUTNOT YOUR HEAD . ECONOMIC CHIEF CHEN YUN OPPOSED MAO'S GREAT LEAP AND ITONLY COST HIM A TEMPORARY FALL FROM POWER . THE OTHER FIVE COMMITTEEMENARE HEIR APPARENT LIU SHAO-CHI (TIME, OCT . 12, 1959), PREMIER CHOUEN-LAI (TIME, MAY 10, 1954), DEFENSE MINISTER LIN PIAO, VICE PREMIERTENG HSIAO-PING AND CONGRESS CHAIRMAN CHU TEH . UNHAPPY GENERALS . THEPEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY NOW 2,600,000 STRONG IS BY FAR THE MOSTIMPRESSIVE PRODUCT OF RED CHINA, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE OFDISSATISFACTION AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE ARMY . AMONG THE GENERALS,THOSE HAVING A GUERRILLA MENTALITY CONFLICT WITH THE PROFESSIONALS, WHOARGUE THAT TO OBTAIN THE SUPPLIES NEEDED BY A MODERN ARMY, CHINA MUSTCOOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION . DEFENSE MINISTER PENGTEH-HUAI, LEADING SPOKESMAN FOR THE PROFESSIONALS, WAS DISMISSED FROMHIS POST IN 1959, BUT REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST CENTRALCOMMITTEE . THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT SERIOUSLY HAMPERS THE AIR FORCE(3,000 PLANES, HALF OF THEM OLD-FASHIONED MIG-15 FIGHTERS), WHICH HASBEEN DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA FOR AIRCRAFT, JET FUEL AND SPARE PARTS . THESPLIT WITH MOSCOW DOUBTLESS UPSET MANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS, AND LASTMAY THE PARTY LAUNCHED ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF ITS PERIODIC CLEANSINGS OFTHE ARMED FORCES . NINETEEN NEW ARMY REGULATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED . THEIRAIM WAS TO " PLACE THE ARMY UNDER ABSOLUTE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND TOGUARANTEE THAT THE ARMY WILL ADVANCE VICTORIOUSLY IN LINE WITH THEDIRECTIVES OF PARTY CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG . /PEKING POSTERS . RED CHINA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS BASEDON PROMOTION OF THE BEST STUDENTS AND WORK FOR THE REST OFTEN AS "CULTURED PEASANTS " TO RAISE THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL IN THE VILLAGES .THESE LUCKLESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HATE THE WHOLE BUSINESS, ANDTHE COMMUNIST PRESS IS CAMPAIGNING TO MAKE EX-STUDENTS " GLADLY "ACCEPT THEIR WORK ASSIGNMENTS . ONE PAPER RECENTLY HEAPED GLORY ON THECOLLEGE STUDENTS WHO SMIRKED SCARCELY AT ALL WHEN ONE OLD GRAD CAMEBACK TO TAKE A JOB ON THE CAMPUS CLEANING THE TOILETS . THE SCHOOLSHAVE BECOME A CASUALTY OF THE GREAT LEAP . IN 1961-62 ENROLLMENT WASCUT 20 PER CENT , AND THEN CUT ANOTHER 20 PER CENT THE FOLLOWING YEAR .THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS, FOR IT WAS STUDENT DISAFFECTION THAT MADETHE COMMUNISTS' TASK ALL THE EASIER IN THEIR FINAL BIG PUSH AGAINST THEKUOMINTANG . COMMUNISM'S PROBLEM, AT THIS MOMENT OF INDUSTRIALSLOWDOWN, IS THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL JOBS,NOT OF EDUCATED PEOPLE . THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS VIEWED THE STUDENTSWITH CONSIDERABLE SUSPICION EVER SINCE THE PERIOD OF THE HUNDREDFLOWERS, WHEN STUDENT MANIFESTOS AND POSTERS DENOUNCING GOVERNMENTEXCESSES WERE SLAPPED ON EVERY SPACE AVAILABLE . SOME TATTERED BITS OFTHESE INFLAMMATORY POSTERS STILL CLING TO THE WALLS AND CEILINGS ATPEKING UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF 100,000 . AMONG THETHOUSANDS OF CHINESE REFUGEES POURING INTO HONG KONG IN THE PAST YEARAND A HALF THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL TRICKLE OF ENGINEERS ANDINTELLECTUALS, FORMER BELIEVERS WHO ARE NOW DISILLUSIONED . THEY ARENOT PARTY MEMBERS, AND THE NUMBER IS NOT LARGE ; THE SIGNIFICANCE LIESIN THE FACT THAT IT IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH COMMUNIST-EDUCATEDINTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN FLEEING RED CHINA . SHEAF OF SECRETS . THESINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES ARE REACHING SUCH A POINT OF BITTERNESS THAT INEARLIER AND SIMPLER TIMES, BOTH NATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOBILIZINGTHEIR ARMIES . YET, FOR ALL THE INTEMPERATENESS OF ITS LANGUAGE, PEKINGHAS BEEN NOTABLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GETTING DEEPLY INVOLVED BEYOND REDCHINA'S OWN FRONTIERS IN LINE WITH THE RED CHINESE AXIOM, " DESPISE THEENEMY STRATEGICALLY, BUT RESPECT HIM TACTICALLY . " THE WEST GOT ANINSIDE LOOK AT RED CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE ON GREAT-POWER CONFLICTS BACK IN1961, WHEN U.S . AGENTS OBTAINED POSSESSION OF A 40,000-WORD SHEAF OFSECRET BULLETINS THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED TO OFFICERS BY THE GENERALPOLITICAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF RED CHINA'S ARMY . IN ONE BULLETIN,LAOS WAS DESCRIBED AS AN IMPERIALIST CORK TO KEEP CHINESE INFLUENCE OUTOF SOUTHEAST ASIA . WITH TYPICAL SELF-CONCERN, THE CHINESE CALLED LAOSTHE " FOCUS " OF THE " WORLDWIDE ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE, " ALTHOUGH,FOR THE RUSSIANS, BERLIN WAS FAR MORE VITAL . BUT PEKING WELCOMED THECEASE-FIRE ORDERED BY THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS . PARTLY, THIS WAS IN LINEWITH THEIR TRADITIONAL FORMULA OF FIGHT A LITTLE, TALK A LITTLE . THECAPTURED DOCUMENTS DISCLOSED THE MILITARY TIE-UP WITH THE 1961 SPRINGOF DESPAIR AT HOME, WHEN RED CHINA FACED INTERNAL UPRISINGS, WIDESPREADFOOD SHORTAGES, AND MORALE PROBLEMS IN THE ARMY ITSELF . SOLDIERSGRUMBLED AT CONDITIONS IN THE VILLAGES, COMPLAINING THAT " AT PRESENT,WHAT THE FARMERS EAT IS EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT DOGS EAT, " AND CHARGING "VILLAGE CADRES WITH BEATING AND SCOLDING PEOPLE JUST AS IN THE OLDSOCIETY . " PEKING WANTED NO ADDITIONAL TROUBLE IN LAOS . WHERE'S THEBOMB ? ANOTHER REASON FOR CHINESE CAUTION WAS THE GLOOMY CONVICTIONTHAT MOSCOW WOULD WITHHOLD HELP . WARNED A COMMUNIST GENERAL, " IFTHERE IS A WAR WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS, WE WILL HAVE TO RELY ON THEWEAPONS WE NOW HAVE . " TODAY THE WEAPONS CHINA MOST DESPERATELY WANTSNUCLEAR WARHEADS ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT . PEKING IS SO BITTER ABOUTMOSCOW'S RENEGING ON ITS 1957 AGREEMENT TO HELP CREATE A RED CHINESEATOM BOMB THAT IT HAS BROADCAST DETAILS OF THE RUSSIAN ABOUT-FACE .CHINESE PHYSICISTS ARE NOW BELIEVED TO BE TWO TO THREE YEARS AWAY FROMDETONATING A NUCLEAR BLAST, FARTHER STILL FROM WHAT THE EXPERTS CALL A/ SIGNIFICANT CAPABILITY . " BUT WORK PROCEEDS ON THE PROJECT, FORPEKING HOPES THAT ACHIEVEMENT OF NUCLEAR STATUS, HOWEVER PRIMITIVE,WILL GAIN PRESTIGE AMONG THE UNDERDEVELOPED MILLIONS ON EARTH WHOSERESPECT AND ALLIANCE THE RED CHINESE ARE OUT TO WIN .THE NOISE FROM PEKING SHOWED NO SIGN OF DIMINISHING AND CONTINUED TOFASCINATE THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD WITH FRESH TALES OF OLD SKELETONS INCOMMUNISTCLOSETS . IN ONE ANNOUNCEMENT, RED CHINA TOOK FULL CREDIT FOR FORCING AWEAK-KNEED KHRUSHCHEV ( " WHO HAD DECIDED TO ABANDON SOCIALIST HUNGARYTO COUNTERREVOLUTION " ) TO SEND RUSSIAN TANKS INTO BUDAPEST AND CRUSHTHE 1956 UPRISING . PEKING RADIO ALSO MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED REFERENCETO IMPORTANT FACTIONAL DISPUTES WITHIN THE TOP RANKS OF THE CHINESECOMMUNIST PARTY . KHRUSHCHEV WAS ACCUSED OF OPENLY VOICING SUPPORT FOR/ ANTIPARTY ELEMENTS " IN CHINA . WESTERN EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CHINESE "ELEMENTS " KHRUSHCHEV WAS SUPPORTING WERE MILITARY MEN WHO OPPOSED THEGROWING SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, MOST LIKELY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER PENGTEH-HUAI AND HIS DEPUTY, HUANG KE-CHENG . KHRUSHCHEV IS ADDITIONALLYCHARGED WITH TRYING TO SELL PEKING ON A " TWO CHINAS " PLAN AS A MEANSOF SETTLING MAO'S QUARREL WITH GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK . PEKINGRADIO ALSO CONFIRMED EARLIER REPORTS THAT RUSSIA WAS STIRRING UP THEKAZAKH TRIBESMEN IN SINKIANG AGAINST THEIR CHINESE MASTERS . ONLY LASTYEAR, RED CHINA CHARGED, RUSSIA HAD LURED SOME 10,000 KAZAKHS INSINKIANG INTO CROSSING THE BORDER INTO SOVIET KAZAKHSTAN . DESPITEREPEATED PROTEST FROM PEKING, RUSSIA REFUSED TO GIVE BACK THE KAZAKHSBECAUSE OF " HUMANITARIANISM " A PRETEXT THAT CHINA CLEARLY REGARDEDAS LUDICROUS . WHETHER OR NOT RED CHINA SUCCEEDS IN ITS GREAT DESIGN TOBE LEADER OF AN AFRO-ASIAN-LATIN AMERICAN ALLIANCE, MAO TSE-TUNG WILLNOT BE AROUND TO SEE THE RESULT . AT 69, MAO NOW NEEDS HELP IN WALKING. HE DISAPPEARS FOR LONG STRETCHES, REPORTEDLY TO MEDITATE IN HISPAVILION FACING LOVELY WEST LAKE IN HANGCHOW . NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHYHE GAVE UP THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958 AFTER ONE TERM INOFFICE . PERHAPS IT WAS TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS KEY JOB AS HEAD OFTHE PARTY . OR WAS HE PREPARING AN ORDERLY TRANSITION FOR HIS SUCCESSOR? SO DEEP IS THE CLEAVAGE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION THAT ITCOULD HARDLY BE RESOLVED EXCEPT BY THE DEATH OR DISAPPEARANCE OF EITHERMAO OR KHRUSHCHEV . BUT, AFTER MAO, WHO ? THE IMMEDIATE SUCCESSOR ISALMOST CERTAIN TO BE LIU SHAO-CHI, THE PARTY'S NO . 2 MAN . AFTER THAT,IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS . COMMENTS A CHINA EXPERT : " FROM THE OUTSIDE,ONE CAN SEE THE FORCES THAT MUST, OR SHOULD BE, COMING TO GRIPS IN THEARENA OF CHINA'S INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE . BUT WE CAN ONLY SEE THESEFORCES INTELLECTUALLY AND, I REPEAT, FROM THE OUTSIDE . WE CAN'TTRANSLATE THEM INTO REAL DEVELOPMENTS OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN CHINA . "WAITING IN THE WINGS ARE THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED PARTYLEADERS PRAGMATIC TECHNICIANS RATHER THAN FANATIC DOGMATISTS WHO HAVEBEEN FRUSTRATED DURING THE YEARS OF OLD GUARD RULE . MAO AND THEVETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH HAVE SUFFERED FEW DEATHS . BUT A SERIES OFSTATE FUNERALS IS OBVIOUSLY AND ACTUARIALLY, IN THE CARDS . CHINA'SFUTURE, AND THAT OF WORLD COMMUNISM, CLEARLY DEPENDS ON WHICH EMERGENTCHINESE COMMUNISTS WILL CARRY THE COFFINS .
