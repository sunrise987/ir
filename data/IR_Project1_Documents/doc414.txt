EGYPT EXODUS FROM NUBIA " WE WENT TO THE GRAVES OF OURANCESTORS FOR THE LAST TIME, " SAID SHEIK AHMED MARDANI . " THE WOMENAND CHILDREN CRIED AND WE TRIED TO CONSOLE THEM, BUT WE KNEW OUR HOMESWERE LOST AND OUR LIVES CHANGED FOREVER . " SHEIK MARDANI'S LAMENT WASFOR HIMSELF AND 100,000 OTHER NUBIANS IN EGYPT WHO LAST WEEK WEREBEING EVACUATED FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND ON THE NILE BANKS . THEEXODUS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE ASWAN HIGH DAM, BEING BUILT BY EGYPTWITH RUSSIAN HELP, NEXT SPRING WILL BACK UP THE NILE, CREATING A HUGE1,800-SQ.-MI . RESERVOIR THAT EVENTUALLY WILL GIVE EGYPT VAST NEWIRRIGATED ACRES AND ELECTRIC POWER . BUT IT WILL ALSO FLOOD THE GAILYPAINTED HOUSES OF THE NUBIANS, THEIR CEMETERIES, MOSQUES AND GROVES OFDATE PALM . WILD VALLEY . IN THEIR WILD, INACCESSIBLE VALLEY, THENUBIANS PROSPERED TRANQUILLY FOR CENTURIES UNTIL THE FIRST ASWAN LOWDAM WAS BUILT IN 1902 . THE RISING NILE WATER DROVE THE VILLAGERSFARTHER UP THE CLIFFS, AND THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED IN 1912 AND 1933 ASTHE DAM WAS SUCCESSIVELY RAISED TO A HEIGHT OF 182 FT . HALF OF NUBIA'S30,000 ARABLE ACRES WERE LOST AND THE REMAINING 15,000 COULD ONLY BEHASTILY CULTIVATED WHEN THE NILE WAS LOW . AS THE LAND VANISHED, NUBIANMEN SOUGHT WORK IN THE CITIES, WHERE THEIR PROVERBIAL HONESTY ANDFANATICAL CLEANLINESS WON THEM JOBS . NOW, AT THE RATE OF 300 A DAY,THE REMAINING NUBIANS ARE BEING MOVED DOWNSTREAM FROM THEIR VILLAGES TOTHE KOM OMBO AREA, SOME 40 MILES NORTH OF ASWAN . THE GOVERNMENT OFPRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, DETERMINED TO MAKE A SHOWPIECE OF KOMOMBO, IS AT WORK ON 25,000 HOUSES, 138 STORES, 33 MOSQUES AND 36SCHOOLS . THE HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT LARGELY TO THE NUBIANS' OWNSPECIFICATIONS, WITH HIGH-WALLED PATIOS, ANIMAL PENS, 12-FT . CEILINGSAND UP TO FOUR BEDROOMS PER HOUSE . THEY WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITHTRADITIONAL NUBIAN FRESCOES STYLIZED SCORPIONS, LIONS, FISH, SNAKES,SUNS, MOONS AND STARS . " AFTER ALL, " SAYS SHEIK MARDANI, " THERE'S NOLAW AGAINST BEAUTY . " THUNDERING EXPRESS . YET MOST NUBIANS WEREAPPALLED BY THE FIRST SIGHT OF THEIR NEW HOME . GROANED ONE OLD MAN :/ I USED TO BE AWAKENED EACH MORNING BY THE MURMURING RIVER WATERS .NOW IT IS THE DAWN CAIRO EXPRESS FROM ASWAN THUNDERING IN MY EARS . "IN NUBIA, POLYGAMOUS HUSBANDS HAD SEPARATE HOUSES FOR EACH WIFE ; ATKOM OMBO, A MAN'S WIVES MUST SHARE HIS HOUSE, AND MANY HUSBANDS,DISMAYED BY THE PROSPECT, HAVE DIVORCED ALL WIVES SAVE ONE . BUT A MANWHO RISKED KEEPING BOTH HIS WIVES CONCEDES THAT THE ARRANGEMENT HASADVANTAGES . " HERE I DO NOT HAVE TO MOVE FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE . I GOONE NIGHT TO ONE ROOM, THE NEXT NIGHT TO THE OTHER ROOM . IT SPARES THESTRENGTH OF MY WIVES AND IS GOOD FOR ME, TOO . SINCE I HAVE A THIRDBEDROOM, I'M THINKING OF GETTING A THIRD WIFE . " NUBIAN WOMEN SEEMHAPPY ABOUT THE MOVE . STONE WALLS AND CONCRETE FLOORS ARE A WELCOMECHANGE AFTER A DUSTY LIFETIME OF ADOBE AND MUD . BESIDES, THERE AREMOVIES, TELEVISION, SCHOOLS AND CLINICS . AS THE NUBIANS FILE ABOARDTHE PADDLE STEAMER HEADED FOR KOM OMBO LOADED DOWN WITH PALM FIBERBEDS, CARVED WOODEN CHESTS, MAGICAL AMULETS, GOATS AND SHEEP THEY TRYTO EXORCISE THEIR GRIEF OF LEAVE-TAKING BY SINGING . ONE SONG RUNS : "THE NILE IS DROWNING NUBIA AND WE MUST FORGET THE PAST . THE RIVERBRINGS LIFE AND THE RIVER BRINGS DEATH . /
