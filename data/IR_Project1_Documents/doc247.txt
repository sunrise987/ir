GREATBRITAIN 2 ON THE FENCE WITH MLF FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT MONTGOMERY OFALAMEIN HAS HIS OWN IDEAS ABOUT THE U.S . PROPOSAL FOR A NATO FLEET OFPOLARIS-FIRING SURFACE SHIPS MANNED BY CREWS OF SEVERAL NATIONALITIES ./ UTTER AND COMPLETE POPPYCOCK ! " HE CRIED IN THE HOUSE OF LORDSLAST WEEK . " HOW, " HE SNORTED, " CAN A SHIP FIGHT EFFECTIVELY IFONE-THIRD OF ITS CREW IS PORTUGUESE, ONE-THIRD BELGIAN AND ONE-THIRD,SAY, DANISH .? THE THING IS JUST NOT ON . YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAN ASHIP WITH A PARTY OF POLITICIANS . " MANY BRITISH POLITICIANS ANDMILITARY EXPERTS SHARE MONTGOMERY'S MISTRUST OF THE MULTILATERAL FORCE(MLF) AND ITS SPONSOR THE U.S . INDEED, THOUGH PRIME MINISTER HAROLDMACMILLAN NOMINALLY AGREED AT NASSAU LAST DECEMBER TO SUPPORT THE NATOFORCE, HIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HOPING EVER SINCE THAT MLF WOULD QUIETLYCAPSIZE OF ITS OWN COMPLEXITY . NAUGHTY QUESTIONS . THE BRITISH APPROVEOF ITS PRIMARY AIM, TO SATISFY WEST GERMANY'S DEMAND FOR A BIGGER ROLEIN NATO'S NUCLEAR DEFENSE, BUT ARGUE THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUILDTHEIR OWN INDEPENDENT POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET AND CONTRIBUTE AS WELL TOMLF, WHOSE 20 TO 25 SHIPS ARE EXPECTED TO COST $5 BILLION OVER ATEN-YEAR PERIOD . THANKS TO WASHINGTON'S SUCCESS IN SELLING MLF TOGERMANY AND THEN TO ITALY, IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS IF THE FLEET MIGHT BEBUILT WITH ONLY A TOKEN CONTRIBUTION FROM BRITAIN . HOWEVER, WHEN ALDOMORO TOOK OVER AS ITALY'S PREMIER-DESIGNATE LAST MONTH, WASHINGTONREALIZED THAT HIS FRAGILE GOVERNMENT IS IN NO POSITION TO HONOR ITSCOMMITMENT TO SHOULDER MLF'S COST, OR EVEN TO PARTICIPATE . THUS THEU.S ., WHICH HAS PROMISED TO CONTRIBUTE 40 PER CENT, AND PERSUADEDTHE GERMANS TO PLEDGE ANOTHER 40 PER CENT , HAS FINALLY PUT PRESSURE ONBRITAIN . TO WHITEHALL'S DISMAY, WASHINGTON ANNOUNCED ITS TOP MLFEXPERT, ADMIRAL CLAUDE RICKETTS, DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS,WOULD FLY TO LONDON THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S TECHNICALRESERVATIONS AND SATISFY BRITISH COMPLAINTS THAT THEY HAVE SO FARRECEIVED NOTHING BUT " COMPUTER ANSWERS " FROM THE PENTAGON . SAID ONEBRITISH OFFICIAL GLEEFULLY : " WE'VE GOT A LOT OF NAUGHTY QUESTIONS ./ COMPELLING LOGIC . BRITAIN'S MAIN OBJECTION TO MLF IS THAT IT ISPRIMARILY A " POLITICAL " SCHEME TO PROMOTE NATO SOLIDARITY . HOWEVER,IF BRITAIN DECIDES NOT TO SUPPORT MLF, IT FACES ONE OF TWO UNPALATABLEALTERNATIVES . EITHER THE PROJECT WILL BE ABANDONED, WITH THELIKELIHOOD THAT THE GERMANS AND OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS WILL ULTIMATELYDEVELOP THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ; OR THE FORCE WILL COME INTO BEINGANYWAY, AND IN TIME MAY DEVELOP INTO A TRULY EUROPEAN DETERRENT,EXCLUSIVE OF BRITAIN . IN EITHER CASE, BRITAIN MIGHT SERIOUSLY STRAINITS TIES WITH THE U.S . BY REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE . RECALLING THATONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED WITH COMPELLING LOGICAGAINST MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH CONCLUDEDLAST WEEK : " WHAT IS SO SAD IS THAT ONCE AGAIN WE SEEM TO BE CLIMBINGRELUCTANTLY INTO A BACK SEAT ON THE BANDWAGON ONLY AFTER IT HAS STARTEDTO MOVE . /
