GREAT BRITAIN THE LOST LEADER AS THE HOUSE OF COMMONSCLOCK TICKED TOWARD STARTING TIME FOR THE GREAT DEBATE, THERE WERE ONLYTWO EMPTY SEATS IN THE JAMMED, EXPECTANT CHAMBER . THE FIRST WASFILLED, WITH FOUR MINUTES TO SPARE, BY HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO SAT DOWNSTIFFLY ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH, LOOKING AS CHILL AND WAN ASHIS EFFIGY AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S . TWO MINUTES LATER, A SHORT, PLUMP MANIN A SHABBY GREY SUIT BUSTLED EXPRESSIONLESSLY DOWN THE GANGWAY, SANKINTO THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH FACING MACMILLAN, AND FINGERED ACARDBOARD FILE . AS THE CLOCK STRUCK, LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSONROSE TO HIS FEET AND FOR A SECOND SAVORED THE TINGLING SILENCE BEFOREBREAKING IT WITH HIS FLAT NASAL YORKSHIRE VOICE . " THIS IS A DEBATE, "HE BEGAN, " WITHOUT PRECEDENCE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HOUSE . " THE TWOMEN WERE THE PRODUCTS OF TWO REMARKABLE POLITICAL CAREERS AND ALSO OFTWO BRITAINS : MACMILLAN, THE SKILLFUL, COURAGEOUS AND OFTEN RUTHLESSPATRICIAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIS COUNTRY FROM THE DEBRIS OF SUEZ AND LEDIT INTO AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY ; HAROLD WILSON, THE DRY,DILIGENT AND OFTEN DEVIOUS SON OF A PROVINCIAL CHEMIST WHO HAD RISEN BYHARD WORK AND CHANCE (INCLUDING THE DEATH OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED, HUGHGAITSKELL) TO THE TOP OF THE LABOR PARTY . AS HE FACED MACMILLAN, WHOHAD GONE TO OXFORD BY FAMILY TRADITION, HAROLD WILSON, WHO HAD GONE TOOXFORD ON A SCHOLARSHIP, STROVE TO EMBODY A NEW, IMPATIENT,CLASS-DEFYING ENGLAND . THE MORAL DECAY SURROUNDING THE PROFUMO AFFAIR,HE TRIED HARD TO SUGGEST, MUST BE BLAMED ON THE TORIES . REFERRING TOCHRISTINE KEELER'S REPORTED $14,000-A-WEEK NIGHTCLUB CONTRACT, WILSONDECLARED : " THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY NAUSEATING ABOUT A SYSTEM OFSOCIETY WHICH PAYS A HARLOT 25 TIMES AS MUCH AS IT PAYS ITS PRIMEMINISTER . " FOR THE REST, HAROLD WILSON STUCK TO THE SECURITY ISSUEAND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PROFUMO CASE, WHICH HE ATTACKED ASEITHER DISHONEST OR INCOMPETENT, OR BOTH . LET DOWN . THE ONCEUNFLAPPABLE MACMILLAN FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT AND KEPT DABBING AT THEPOUCHES BENEATH HIS EYES WITH A CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF . WHEN HE ROSE,HE OPENLY PLAYED FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS COLLEAGUES . " WHAT HASHAPPENED, " HE SAID, " HAS INFLICTED A DEEP, BITTER AND LASTING WOUNDON ME . " ESSENTIALLY HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVEDBY PROFUMO AN " ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE " CULPRIT AND BADLY LET DOWN BY HISSUBORDINATES, WHO FAILED TO KEEP HIM INFORMED . FROM THE BACK BENCHESCAME A RUDE GIBE OF " NOBODY EVER TELLS ME NUFFIN ! " BY THE TIMEMACMILLAN FINISHED, THE HOUSE WAS PREPARED TO ACQUIT HIM OF PERSONALDISHONESTY AND MORAL TURPITUDE, BUT HE HAD CONVICTED HIMSELF OFNEGLIGENCE AND NAIVETE OR PERHAPS SIMPLY OF A FATAL ABILITY TO AVERTHIS EYES FROM WHAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE . IN THE VOTE FOLLOWING THEDEBATE, 27 CONSERVATIVES VOTED AGAINST MACMILLAN OR ABSTAINED . ON ALLSIDES THERE WERE CRIES OF " RESIGN, RESIGN, " AND THIS IS WHATMACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTIONBEING WHEN . THE WARNING . THE LONG DEBATE SERVED TO FIX GOVERNMENTRESPONSIBILITY, OR THE LACK OF IT, AND ILLUSTRATED THE ODD NATURE OFTHE BRITISH SECURITY SYSTEM, COMPOUNDED OF SHREWDNESS, INEFFICIENCY,AND AN OFTEN MISGUIDED SENSE OF SPORTSMANSHIP THAT GOES TOEXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS IN PROTECTING MEMBERS OF THE CLUB . THE CASE, ASIT EMERGED FROM THE DEBATE, FALLS INTO FOUR PHASES .FIRST, THERE WAS THE CHRISTINE-PROFUMO AFFAIRITSELF, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PROFUMO, LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS, FROMJULY TO DECEMBER 1961, BUT BY OTHER EVIDENCE POSSIBLY LASTED LONGER .DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS, CHRISTINE ALSO ENTERTAINED RUSSIAN ASSISTANTNAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV, WHO HAD BEEN PALS FOR SOME TIME WITH HERMENTOR, DR . STEPHEN WARD . MI-5, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE, APPARENTLYDISCOVERED ONLY HALF OF WHAT WILSON SCATHINGLY CALLED " THIS DINGYQUADRILATERAL . " IN AUGUST 1961, ACCORDING TO THE COMMONS DEBATE,CABINET SECRETARY SIR NORMAN BROOK WARNED PROFUMO THAT IT WOULD BEBETTER FOR THE SECRETARY FOR WAR NOT TO BE TOO FRIENDLY WITH WARD ; HEDID NOT MENTION, AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, CHRISTINE . NOTHINGOF THIS WAS REPORTED TO MACMILLAN . IN THE SECOND PHASE, WHICH COVERSMOST OF 1962, RUMORS OF THE AFFAIR KEPT REACHING THE NEWSPAPERS, TORYAND LABOR POLITICIANS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE PRIME MINISTER . DURINGTHE CUBA BLOWUP, WARD WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUGGESTING TO THE PRIMEMINISTER'S OFFICE AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT HIS FRIEND IVANOV BEUSED AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO HELP SETTLE THE CRISIS . BUT SAID MACMILLAN,A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE THEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE ACT " TO WEAKEN OURRESOLUTION . " A LITTLE LATER, WILSON HIMSELF GOT A LETTER FROM WARD,BOASTING OF HIS SUPPOSED HELP IN SETTLING THE CUBA MATTER, BUT FILED ITAWAY AS COMING FROM A CRANK . BEFORE IVANOV WAS RECALLED TO MOSCOW INJANUARY 1963, HE AROUSED SUSPICION IN OTHER WAYS . A BRIDGE PLAYER WHOTOOK A HAND IN SOME VERY HIGH-LEVEL GAMES, HE LOST STEADILY, AS MUCH AS$140 A NIGHT . " I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S PETTY CASH WOULDSTAND SUCH LOSSES EVERY NIGHT, " SAID ONE LABOR M.P . CAUSTICALLY, /UNLESS THEY GOT SOMETHING FOR IT . " THE VIGIL . IN THE THIRD AND MOSTREMARKABLE PHASE, MACMILLAN FINALLY BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS SUCH ATHING AS A PROFUMO CASE . IN JANUARY 1963, AS MACMILLAN TOLD COMMONSPOLICE LEARNED FROM CHRISTINE THAT WARD HAD ASKED HER TO FIND OUT FROMPROFUMO WHEN THE U.S . WAS TO DELIVER CERTAIN NUCLEAR INFORMATION ANDWARHEADS TO WEST GERMANY (SHE SAID THAT SHE REFUSED TO DO IT) .MACMILLAN WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS EITHER . BUT WHILE HE WAS AWAY IN ITALY,THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUGE (CIRC . 6,500,000) NEWS OF THE WORLDREPORTED THE PROFUMO RUMORS TO MACMILLAN'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY. CONFRONTED WITH THE STORY, PROFUMO DENIED EVERYTHING TO SEVERALOFFICIALS ; THE RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN INNOCENT, HE SAID, AND ANYWAYHAD ENDED LONG BEFORE . WHY DIDN'T THE PRIME MINISTER QUESTION PROFUMOHIMSELF AT ANY TIME ? MACMILLAN'S LAME ANSWER : HE ASSUMED THATPROFUMO WOULD SPEAK MORE FREELY TO OTHERS, AND FURTHERMORE SUCH ANINTERROGATION WOULD HAVE MADE " SOCIAL RELATIONS " BETWEEN HIMSELF ANDPROFUMO HIGHLY EMBARRASSING . AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ATTEMPT TOINTERROGATE CHRISTINE HERSELF TO CHECK OUT PROFUMO'S DENIAL ? TOTHIS, MACMILLAN HAD NO ANSWER AT ALL . AFTER CHRISTINE FAILED TO APPEARAS A WITNESS LAST MARCH IN THE TRIAL OF A JEALOUS NEGRO LOVER WHO HADTRIED TO SHOOT HER, QUESTIONS WERE FINALLY RAISED IN PARLIAMENT .MACMILLAN ASKED FOR ACTION, ADMITTEDLY HOPING FOR A STATEMENT FROMPROFUMO THAT WOULD QUELL FURTHER RUMORS IN THE PRESS THROUGH FEAR OFLIBEL . WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNED AFTER MIDNIGHT, PROFUMO WAS AWAKENED,AND AT 1 : 30 A.M . CAME TO CHIEF TORY WHIP MARTIN REDMAYNE'S COMMONSOFFICE WITH HIS SOLICITOR . HE WAS CONFRONTED BY REDMAYNE, TORYCHAIRMAN IAIN MACLEOD, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO WILLIAM DEEDES,ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR JOHN HOBSON AND SOLICITOR GENERAL SIR PETERRAWLINSON . TWO OF PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS HAD BEEN AT HARROW WITH HIM. WHERE LAST WEEK HEWAS EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DISMISSED FROM THE INTELLIGENCESERVICE, AND SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL .THE LETTER . UNDER FRIENDLY QUESTIONING UNTIL5 A.M., PROFUMO DENIED MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE . HE AGREED TO MAKE ASACROSANCT " PERSONAL STATEMENT, " ASSURING THE HOUSE THAT HE HADCOMMITTED " NO IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER " WITH MISS KEELER . HIS FELLOWMINISTERS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADMIT AT LEAST TO BEING " ON FRIENDLY TERMSWITH HER, " ALTHOUGH IT " SOUNDED SO AWFUL, " AS PROFUMO PUT IT . " WEINSISTED THAT IT MUST BE INCLUDED, " EXPLAINED MACLEOD FATUOUSLY LASTWEEK, " BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE TRUTH . " AGAINST HIMSELF AND THEFOUR OTHER MINISTERS, MACLEOD ADDED, " TWO POSSIBLE CHARGES CAN BEBROUGHT . FIRST, THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING KNAVES, AND SECONDLY, THAT WEWERE GULLIBLE FOOLS . " THEY WERE INDEED GULLIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEYWANTED TO BE . EVEN THE MOST CURSORY CHECKING WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THATWHILE CHRISTINE MAY HAVE HAD JOIE DE VIVRE, SHE HAD LITTLE DISCRETION .PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS KNEW BY THEN ABOUT A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TOCHRISTINE IN 1961 BEGINNING " DARLING . . . " PROFUMO EXPLAINED, ASMACMILLAN PUT IT, THAT IN HIS CIRCLES " IT WAS A TERM OF NO GREATSIGNIFICANCE . I BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ACCEPTED . I DO NOT LIVEAMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY WIDELY . " BUT IF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TOMACMILLAN, AT 69 A LITTLE REMOTE FROM REALITY, IT SHOULD NOT HAVEFOOLED THE OTHERS . " WE WERE A BUNCH OF NINNIES, " ADMITS ONE OF THEFIVE PRIVATELY, AND ADDS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOGIC : " WE RECALLED THATEARLIER CASE, IN WHICH " MY DEAR VASSALL' PROVED TO BE HARMLESS, SO WEWERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT " DARLING' MIGHT WELL BE SIMILARLY HARMLESS . "THE EXIT . THE LAST PHASE OF THE CASE BEGAN AFTER PROFUMO PROCLAIMEDHIS PURITY TO THE HOUSE, WAS WARMLY PATTED ON THE BACK BY THE PRIMEMINISTER, AND WITH HIS WIFE, ACTRESS VALERIE HOBSON, WENT OFF TO THERACES WITH THE QUEEN MOTHER, AND LATER ATTENDED A TORY BALL ATQUAGLINO'S, A WEST END NIGHTCLUB . BUT THERE WERE EDITORS AND M.P.'SWHO KNEW BY NOW THAT HE HAD LIED, AND PROFUMO SHOWED HIMSELF BOTHARROGANT AND STUPID IN THINKING THAT HE COULD SUPPRESS THE TRUTHINDEFINITELY BY LIBEL SUITS . (IN FACT, HE SUED PARIS-MATCH FOR LIBELAND COLLECTED OUT OF COURT FROM ITALY'S TEMPO ILLUSTRATO.) BESIDES,WARD BEGAN TO TALK, AND TO LABOR M.P . GEORGE WIGG HE UNFOLDED A TALE,AS WILSON DESCRIBED IT IN THE COMMONS, THAT " TOOK THE LID OFF A CORNEROF THE LONDON UNDERWORLD VICE AND DOPE, MARIJUANA, BLACKMAIL ANDCOUNTER-BLACKMAIL, VIOLENCE, PETTY CRIME . " ADDED WILSON GRATUITUOUSLY: " IF WARD'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AS A FICTION PAPERBACK INAMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED OVERDRAWN AND BEYOND BELIEF . "  WILSONSENT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WARDWIGG CONVERSATION TO MACMILLAN, WHO TURNEDIT OVER TO THE " APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES, " WHO FOUND NOTHINGDISTURBING IN IT . PRODDED FURTHER, MACMILLAN WROTE WILSON : " THERESEEMS TO BE NOTHING IN THE PAPERS YOU SENT WHICH REQUIRES ME TO TAKEANY ACTION . /WHEN JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL ADMIRALTY CLERK, WAS CONVICTEDLAST OCTOBER OF SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS, MACMILLAN SUMMARILY FIRED THECLERK'S SUPERIOR, THOMAS GALBRAITH, WHO HAD WRITTEN THE CLERK SOMELETTERS STARTING " MY DEAR VASSALL . " GALBRAITH WAS LATER WHOLLYEXONERATED .THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT IN BRITAIN, WHERE TROPIC OF CANCER HAS BEEN ABESTSELLER FOR MONTHS AND THE UNEXPURGATED LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER HASSOLD 3,500,000 PAPERBACK COPIES .EVEN AFTER WARD SENT WILSON, THE HOMESECRETARY AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH PRESS A LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PROFUMOHAD LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE DISCLOSURE " DID NOT SEEM TO MAKEANY IMPRESSION " ON THE PRIME MINISTER . WHILE ORDERING THE LORDCHANCELLOR TO INVESTIGATE WARD'S CHARGES, MACMILLAN ASSURED WILSON HEWAS CONFIDENT NONETHELESS THAT THE SECURITY QUESTION HAD BEEN " FULLYAND EFFICIENTLY WATCHED " ALTHOUGH, AS WILSON ACCURATELY POINTED OUT,MI-5 MEN APPARENTLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTINE UNTIL THEY READ ABOUTHER IN THE PAPERS . AS THE DISMAL FACTS AND ALIBIS TUMBLED OUT IN THECOMMONS, THE ADULATION AND AFFECTION THE TORIES HAD ONCE BESTOWED ON "MACWONDER " TURNED ALMOST VISIBLY TO A KIND OF STUPEFIED PITY . AT THEEND OF HIS DEFENSE, MACMILLAN PLEADED : " I AM ENTITLED TO THESYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE AND OF THECOUNTRY . " BUT FROM THE TORY BENCHES, AS HE SAT DOWN, CAME A SOUNDTHAT WAS MORE SIGH THAN CHEER . BY TWOS AND THREES, PERTURBEDBACKBENCHERS WENT OUT TO ARGUE IN THE LOBBIES WHILE SEVERAL TORYSPEAKERS CAUSTICALLY CONDEMNED THE PRIME MINISTER . MACMILLAN ROSE ANDWITH BOWED HEAD LEFT THE CHAMBER . WHO NEXT ? SOME ANGRY TORIES FELTTHAT MACMILLAN SHOULD RESIGN AT ONCE, BUT AT A BACKBENCHERS' MEETINGTHE VIEW PREVAILED THAT, AS ONE CABINET MINISTER PUT IT, " THE COUNTRYMUST NOT GET THE FEELING THAT HE IS BEING HOUNDED OUT BECAUSE OFCHRISTINE KEELER . OUR PARTY WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT . " THEPRESENT CONSENSUS IS THAT MACMILLAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETIRE RATHERTHAN TO RESIGN, SOME TIME THIS SUMMER OR FALL . IN PERSPECTIVE, HE MAYWELL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTERS IN TORY HISTORY,BUT FEW CONSERVATIVES WANT HIM IN COMMAND OF THEIR NEXT ELECTIONCAMPAIGN ; EVEN PREPROFUMO, THE PARTY HAD BEEN IN BAD TROUBLE OVERDEFENSE MUDDLES, BRITAIN'S FAILURE TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, ANDABOVE ALL MACMILLAN'S STOP-AND-GO FISCAL POLICIES AND A SLUGGISHECONOMY . ALTHOUGH MACMILLAN HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATED RIVALS BYGIVING THEM THANKLESS TASKS OR SACKING THEM, THE TORIES HAVE A NUMBEROF HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE SUCCESSORS . CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD (DAILY EXPRESSODDS : 4-7) IS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING, WHO ISYOUTHFUL (46) AND READY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A PREDICTED ECONOMIC SPURTTHIS SUMMER . HE IS ALSO HAPPILY MARRIED, A PARTICULARLY USEFULQUALIFICATION RIGHT NOW . NEXT ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER " RAB " BUTLER(2-1), WHO HAS ALL THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, BUT AT 60 MAY HAVE BEENAROUND TOO LONG ; AND LORD HAILSHAM, BELLICOSE, BLIMPISH SCIENCEMINISTER, 55, WHOSE HOPES FADED RAPIDLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID THATITS LORDS REFORM BILL, WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO SIT IN THE COMMONS,WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED THIS SUMMER . TED HEATH, 46, IS GENERALLY RULEDOUT BECAUSE HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON MARKET FAILURE, ANDBESIDES, HE IS A BACHELOR . WHAT NEXT ? ANY ONE OF THESE TORIES COULDGIVE LABOR A GOOD FIGHT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE TO BEHELD TILL THE FALL OF 1964 . BUT LABORITES FEEL THEMSELVES CLOSER TOPOWER THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST DOZEN YEARS . AT WEEK'SEND HAROLD WILSON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK IN THE COMMONS, DEMANDING ANINVESTIGATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE BY A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEEWITH SWEEPOING POWERS . THE MORE LIMITED JUDICIAL INQUIRY PROPOSED BYMACMILLAN, CRIED WILSON, WAS MERELY " A COVER-UP, " BECAUSE, WITHOUTAUTHORITY TO COMPEL PROOF OF THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES, IT WOULD HAVETO COLLECT EVIDENCE " FROM SOME OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED LIARS IN THISCOUNTRY WERE THERE ANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME WILSON WANTED TO KNOW. NOTHING HE KNEW OF RIGHT NOW, SAID MACMILLAN, BUT HE ADDED : " IHAVE HEARD TERRIBLE THINGS SAID OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE THE MOSTAUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF ALL, CHRISTINE HERSELF, VOLUNTEERED : " APARTFROM THOSE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY STORY, I DO NOT KNOW AND HAVENOT MET ANY MINISTERS . " MACMILLAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE . " THEYHAVE DEEPLY WOUNDED ME, " HE TOLD A TORY RALLY, ADDING : " IT WILL NOTBREAK MY SPIRIT . " BUT THE HOUSE STILL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF TORYREBEL NIGEL BIRCH, WHO DURING THE BIG DEBATE HAD QUOTED BROWNING'S THELOST LEADER AT HAROLD MACMILLAN : LET HIM NEVER COME BACK TO US !THERE WOULD BE DOUBT, HESITATION AND PAIN . FORCED PRAISE ON OUR PARTTHE GLIMMER OF TWILIGHT, NEVER GLAD CONFIDENT MORNING AGAIN !
