CONGO UNDER THE KNIFE SUFFERING FROM AMOEBIC DYSENTERY,FAINTING SPELLS AND AN INFLAMED KIDNEY, MOISE TSHOMBE, 43, WAS BEINGTREATED LAST WEEK IN THE CLINIQUE DE PASSY IN PARIS . AT THE SAME TIME,HIS ONCE POTENT AND ECONOMICALLY HEALTHY DOMAIN OF KATANGA WAS GOINGUNDER THE KNIFE BACK IN THE CONGO . LAST YEAR THE CONGO CENTRALGOVERNMENT CUT NORTH KATANGA OUT OF TSHOMBE'S FORMER DOMAIN, LEAVINGHIM ONLY THE SOUTHERN PART . NOW THE GOVERNMENT SUBDIVIDED THE AREAFURTHER, INTO THE PROVINCES OF EAST KATANGA AND LUALABA (SEE MAP) . THEPURPOSE OF THE GERRYMANDER IS TO REMOVE ANY POWER BASE TO WHICH TSHOMBEMIGHT RETURN . PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA AND OTHER CENTRAL-GOVERNMENTLEADERS IN LEOPOLDVILLE HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED OF A RENEWED SECESSIONATTEMPT IN KATANGA ONCE U.N . TROOPS PULL OUT OF THE CONGO . A PERSONALCAMPAIGN AGAINST TSHOMBE BEGAN LAST MAY WHEN HIS BODYGUARD WAS FORCIBLYDISBANDED . NEXT TSHOMBE'S CORRESPONDENCE WAS SEIZED, WITH HINTS THATIT GAVE PROOF OF TREASONABLE DESIGNS . THE AILING TSHOMBE TOOK THE HINTAND LEFT FOR EUROPE, VOWING : " I WILL COME BACK, AND I WILL NOTABANDON MY POST . " TECHNICALLY, MOISE TSHOMBE IS STILL ELIGIBLE TO RUNFOR OFFICE IN EAST KATANGA . BUT SINCE MUCH OF TSHOMBE'S POLITICALSTRENGTH LIES WITH THE LUANDA TRIBE, NOW ISOLATED IN THE NEW LUALABAPROVINCE, HIS CHANCES MIGHT BE SLIM . THOUGH TSHOMBE STILL HASCONSIDERABLE POPULARITY IN KATANGA, THE EUROPEANS THERE WANT NO MOREADVENTURES, AND THE FLOURISHING UNION MINIERE ASKS ONLY THAT IT BEALLOWED TO MINE COPPER UNDISTURBED AND CONTINUE EARNING $260 MILLION AYEAR FOR THE CONGO MORE THAN TWICE THE EXPORT REVENUE OF THE REST OFTHE COUNTRY . THE SECESSIONIST SPIRIT SEEMS TO BE DYING . SAYS ONE OFTSHOMBE'S OLD MINISTERS : " WE WERE PUPPETS PROTECTING EUROPEANINTERESTS, AND NOW NOBODY WANTS TO PULL OUR STRINGS . IT'S ALL OVER .WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THE DICTATES OF LEOPOLDVILLE .
