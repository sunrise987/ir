GREAT BRITAIN INTO BATTLE " I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FIGHT, /SAID SIR ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME LAST WEEK . " I'M ALMOST SPOILING FOR IT . "HE DID NOT HAVE LONG TO SPOIL . NEXT DAY, AS PARLIAMENT REASSEMBLED,SHOUTING, LEAPING TORY BACKBENCHERS CHEERED LUSTILY WHILE THE NEWLYELECTED MEMBER FOR KINROSS TOOK HIS OATH AS AN M.P . AND MOVED INTO HISPLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH . PULLING OUTA SMALL RED AND GOLD BALLPOINT PEN, DOUGLAS-HOME HUNCHED DOWN IN HISSEAT AND SCRIBBLED FURIOUSLY ON SLIPS OF PAPER FOR THE NEXT 42 MINUTESWHILE LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON DELIVERED A CUTTING ATTACK ONTHE GOVERNMENT . LIKE A POSTER . CLAIMING THAT THE TORIES' "MODERNIZATION " PLANS FOR NEW ROADS, SCHOOLS AND HOUSING WERE BORROWEDFROM LABOR, WILSON SAID TARTLY : " IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OFPOLITICAL DESPERATION . " WHY, HE CONTINUED, " HAVE WE HEARD SO LITTLEABOUT MODERNIZATION IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS ? I NEVER UNDERVALUE THEPOWER OF REPENTANCE, BUT IT HAS TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME . " AMID CRIESOF APPROVAL AND DERISION FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE PACKED HOUSE, THE PRIMEMINISTER ROSE, NERVOUSLY SHUFFLED HIS NOTES AND PLACED THEM NEATLY ONTHE DISPATCH BOX IN FRONT OF HIM . " IT'S BEEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE ILAST SPOKE IN THIS HOUSE, " HE BEGAN. IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES ITBECAME ALL TOO PLAIN THAT THE COZIER, CLUBBISH STYLE OF THE HOUSE OFLORDS HAD BLUNTED DOUGLAS-HOME'S DEBATING THRUST, AND HIS SUPPORTERSMISSED HIS USUAL PUNGENT WIT . AFTER A LONG, MEANDERING PREAMBLE, HELAUNCHED INTO A LACKLUSTER EXPOSITION OF AMBITIOUS GOVERNMENT POLICIESFOR THE COMING YEAR . " THE FORMULA, " SAID HE FLATLY, " IS GROWTHWITHOUT INFLATION, AND THE METHOD, ACCELERATION FROM POSITIONSPREVIOUSLY PREPARED . " GROANED ONE CONSERVATIVE : " GOD, IT'S LIKE ATORY ELECTION POSTER ! " TWICE SIR ALEC EVEN MADE THE TACTICAL GAFFEOF REFERRING TO WILSON AS " POSSIBLE LATER PRIME MINISTER . " THE TORYBENCHES REMAINED DEATHLY SILENT WHILE LABOR'S TRIUMPHANT ROAR SURGEDAROUND THE SLIGHT, PALE PRIME MINISTER . FIRMER GROUND . HE WENT ONMANFULLY, BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN LABOR'S UPROARIOUS BARRACKING SILENCEDHIM FOR PAINFUL SECONDS AT A TIME . HE WADED THROUGH THE UNFAMILIARMARSHES OF ECONOMICS, FINALLY REACHED FIRMER GROUND WHEN HE TURNED TOFOREIGN POLICY . STARING COLDLY AT WILSON, WHO WANTS TO ABANDONBRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT DETERRENT, SIR ALEC DECLARED THAT HE INTENDS TOMAKE THIS A CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN . ONCE BRITAIN RENOUNCESNUCLEAR ARMS, HE WARNED, " WE COULD NEVER GO BACK INTO THIS BUSINESS .THE GOVERNMENT MEANS TO RETAIN NUCLEAR FORCES UNDER OUR OWN CONTROL, "ADDING THAT WITHOUT THEM " WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A PLACE AT THE PEACETABLE AS OF RIGHT . " THE CUBAN CRISIS, HE SAID, FORCED RUSSIA TO "MODIFY ITS TACTICS, " BUT " THE COMMUNIST AIM IS CLEARLY STILLUNCHANGED . IT IS TO DESTROY OUR WAY OF LIFE . " IN COLD TYPE NEXT DAY,HIS SPEECH READ CREDITABLY ENOUGH . BUT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSETHERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S EAGERLY AWAITED COMMONSDEBUT HAD BEEN A DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE .HE SAT IN THE COMMONS FROM 1931 TO 1945 AS M.P. FOR SOUTH LANARK, WAS RE-ELECTED IN 1950 BUT WENT TO THE LORDS AFTERSUCCEEDING TO THE 14TH EARLDOM OF HOME IN 1951 .
