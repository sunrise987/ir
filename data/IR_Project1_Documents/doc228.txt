EUROPE FIRST, THE SHELL IN MAJOR DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCES ONBOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC, THE U.S . LAST WEEK CONFRONTED THE NEW,ASSERTIVE EUROPE . AT GENEVA, THE U.S . STARTED TO BARGAIN FOR ITSFUTURE ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE COMMON MARKET, WHICH IS JUST FIVEYEARS OLD AND IS ALREADY THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADING BLOC . AT OTTAWA,IN RECOGNITION OF ITS ALLIES' NEW STRENGTH, THE U.S . INITIATED THESLOW, PAINFUL PROCESS OF SHARING WITH EUROPE CONTROL OF NATO'S NUCLEARARMORY . IF NEITHER CONFERENCE PRODUCED DRAMATIC RESULTS, BOTH NARROWLYSKIRTED BREAKDOWNS THAT MIGHT HAVE GRAVELY DAMAGED THE ATLANTICPARTNERSHIP . NAKED EUROPEANS . DESPITE FRANCE'S AVERSION TOTARIFF-CUTTING, U.S . NEGOTIATORS AT GENEVA HOPED TO ACHIEVEFAR-REACHING LIBERALIZATION OF WORLD TRADE THROUGH PRESIDENT KENNEDY'STRADE EXPANSION ACT . SPECIAL ENVOY CHRISTIAN HERTER AND HIS 20-MANDELEGATION WHO WERE DUBBED " ONWARD CHRISTIAN'S SOLDIERS " BY THE PRESSCORPS AIMED FOR AN AGREEMENT WHEREBY EUROPE AND THE U.S . WOULD MAKEBIG, EQUAL, ACROSS-THE-BOARD PERCENTAGE CUTS ON HUGE CATEGORIES OFGOODS . NOTHING DOING, RETORTED THE EUROPEANS, WHO POINTED OUT THAT U.S. TARIFFS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN EUROPE'S, WHILE THE HIGHEST U.S .TARIFFS COVER FAR MORE GOODS (20 PER CENT OF ALL U.S . TARIFFS ARE OVER30 PER CENT V . 1 PER CENT OF EUROPE'S) . THUS, PROTESTED EUROCRATS, IFEUROPEAN NATIONS CUT THEIR ALREADY LOWER TARIFFS BY THE SAME PERCENTAGEAS THE U.S., THEY WOULD END UP " NAKED, " WHILE THE U.S . WOULD STILLBE COMPARATIVELY WELL PROTECTED . IN ANY CASE, SHRUGGED EUROPEANS, THEU.S . IN 1962 EARNED NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH ($4.4 BILLION) IN THE COMMONMARKET AS IT BOUGHT FROM THE SIX . SO WHY MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THEAMERICANS ? INSIDE THE EGG . THE TALKS ACTUALLY HAD BROKEN DOWN, WHENWEST GERMANY'S LUDWIG ERHARD DEVISED THE LAST-DITCH COMPROMISE THATPROVED ACCEPTABLE TO JOHN F . KENNEDY . IT CALLS FOR BOTH SIDES TO MAKEEQUAL, ACROSS-THE-BOARD PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS, AS PROPOSED BY THE U.S .THOUGH THEY WILL PROBABLY FALL FAR SHORT OF THE IDEAL 50 PER CENTENVISAGED BY WASHINGTON . IN RETURN, THE U.S . AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TOMAKE DRASTIC CUTS IN THE HIGHEST TARIFF CATEGORIES . SINCE THE FINEPRINT WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE NEGOTIATED UNTIL MAY 1964, SOME U.S . ANDBRITISH OFFICIALS WERE FEARFUL, AS ONE PUT IT, THAT " FRANCE HAS ONLYMOVED HER ROADBLOCK DOWN THE ROAD . " CONCLUDED ERHARD : " WE AREAGREED ON THE SHELL OF AN EGG . WHAT WILL BE IN THE EGG, WE DO NOT KNOW. " AT OTTAWA EVERYONE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE EGG, BUT NO ONE KNEW WHATTO CALL IT . WELL IN ADVANCE OF LAST WEEK'S SEMIANNUAL NATO COUNCILMEETING, THE U.S . AND ITS ALLIES HAD AGREED ON A NEW ADDITION TONATO'S ALPHABETICAL ARMORY : IANF, MEANING INTERALLIED NUCLEAR FORCE .A LIMITED FIRST STEP TOWARD GIVING NATO ITS OWN NUCLEAR DETERRENT, IANFNOW CONSISTS MAINLY OF 180 BRITISH V-BOMBERS AND THREEMEDITERRANEAN-BASED U.S . POLARIS SUBMARINES THAT THE TWO NATIONS WILLTURN OVER TO NATO COMMAND . WHILE IT ALSO INCLUDES 60 FRENCH TACTICALBOMBERS, FOR WHICH THE U.S . CONTROLS THE NUCLEAR WARHEADS, THE FRENCHGOVERNMENT HINTED THAT IT MIGHT WITHDRAW THEM IF IANF WERE MADE TO SEEMBIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AS IT IS THAN FRANCE'S VAUNTED FORCE DE FRAPPE. THUS THE ALLIES AGREED THAT IF FRANCE AGREED NOT TO MAKE ANY SCENESAT OTTAWA, IANF WOULD BE NAMELESS IT SOON BECAME KNOWN AS THAT THING BYANY NAME, THE NEW FORCE IS INTENDED TO GIVE THE NATO ALLIES A GREATERSENSE OF PARTICIPATION IN NUCLEAR STRATEGY, BUT WILL DO LITTLE TOINCREASE THEIR ACTUAL ROLE IN THE DEFENSE OF EUROPE . A MORESIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, IN THE U.S . VIEW, WOULD BE FORMATION OF AMULTILATERAL FORCE (MLF), COMPRISING SOME 20 POLARIS-FIRING SURFACEVESSELS THAT WOULD BE JOINTLY OWNED, CREWED AND PAID FOR BY THEPARTICIPATING ALLIES . ITS MAIN PURPOSE, OF COURSE, WOULD BE TOACCOMMODATE WEST GERMANY'S EAGERNESS FOR A NUCLEAR ROLE COMMENSURATEWITH ITS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER . BUT THE U.S . WILL HAVE TOYIELD FAR MORE IF IT IS TO MEET ITS ALLIES' DEMANDS FOR CONTROL OFTHEIR OWN NUCLEAR DEFENSE . IN OTTAWA, AS AT GENEVA, THE DIALOGUE HADBARELY BEGUN
