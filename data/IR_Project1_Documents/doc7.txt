KASHMIR TALKING AT LAST THE BRITISH RAJ, WHICH ONCECONTROLLED INDIA'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE OF KASHMIR, EXACTED ATOKEN ANNUAL TRIBUTE OF TWO KASHMIRI SHAWLS AND THREE HANDKERCHIEFSFROM THE MAHARAJAH . NEVER SINCE HAS THE PRICE OF PEACE BEEN AS SMALL .IN THE YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN 1947 SPLIT THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENTINTO THE SOVEREIGN STATES OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN, THE TWO NATIONS HAVEPAID WITH STRIFE AND BLOODSHED TO ESTABLISH THEIR CONFLICTING CLAIMSOVER THE DISPUTED REGION . LAST WEEK, AFTER 15 YEARS OF BITTERWRANGLING, INDIAN AND PAKISTANI DELEGATES FINALLY MET IN THE PAKISTANCAPITAL OF RAWALPINDI TO SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE KASHMIR PROBLEM . THEDISPUTED LAND IS THE SIZE OF MINNESOTA, LAKES AND ALL . IT FALLS FROMTHE WINDWHIPPED MOUNTAINS OF GILGIT AND LADAKH IN THE NORTH TO THEIDYLLIC VALE OF KASHMIR . IN THE HIMALAYAS, PRIMITIVE MOUNTAINTRIBESMEN KEEP HERDS OF GRACEFUL, SURE-FOOTED KASHMIR GOATS, WHOSE SOFTFLEECE BECOMES THE CASHMERE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND REGENT STREET ; THECOOL LAKES NEAR KASHMIR'S CAPITAL CITY OF SRINAGAR ARE DOTTED WITH THEELEGANT HOUSEBOATS OF WEALTHY INDIANS . VOW FORGOTTEN . AT THE TIME OFPARTITION, KASHMIR, LIKE ALL OF INDIA'S 562 PRINCELY STATES, WAS GIVENTHE CHOICE OF JOINING EITHER PAKISTAN OR INDIA . THE FACT THAT 77 PERCENT OF KASHMIR'S 4,200,000 PEOPLE WERE MOSLEM POINTED TO CONTROL BYMOSLEM PAKISTAN . BUT THOUGH HE HAD SIGNED PRELIMINARY TRADE ANDADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAKISTAN, KASHMIR'S HINDU MAHARAJAHBEGAN TO HEDGE . ANGERED BY HIS FAILURE TO ACCEDE TO PAKISTAN, HORDESOF PAKISTANI " VOLUNTEERS " SWEPT INTO KASHMIR TO ESTABLISH PAKISTAN'SCLAIM TO THE LAND . IN TERROR, THE HINDU RULER OPTED TO JOIN INDIA,APPEALED FOR IMMEDIATE MILITARY AID . INDIA WAS HAPPY TO RESPOND,AIRLIFTED TROOPS INTO KASHMIR TO FORTIFY ITS OWN CLAIM . THUS BEGAN AFULL-SCALE WAR IN KASHMIR . INDIA WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS FOR RELIEF. IN 1949 THE U.N . DEMARCATED A CEASE-FIRE LINE THAT GAVE INDIA THERICHEST TWO-THIRDS OF KASHMIR, INCLUDING MOST OF LADAKH, THE VALE, ANDTHE PREDOMINANTLY HINDU AREA OF JAMMU . BUT INDIA'S PRIME MINISTERJAWAHARLAL NEHRU HAD PLEDGED THAT " THE FATE OF KASHMIR MUST ULTIMATELYBE DECIDED BY ITS PEOPLE . " DECLARED NEHRU : " WE ARE PREPARED, WHENPEACE, LAW AND ORDER HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, TO HAVE A REFERENDUM UNDERSOME INTERNATIONAL AUSPICES LIKE THE U.N . " NEHRU SOON FORGOT THATVOW, FOR IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT KASHMIR WOULD VOTE EITHER FORINDEPENDENCE OR ACCESSION TO PAKISTAN . INDIAN KASHMIR'S MOSLEM RULER,SHEIK MOHAMMED ABDULLAH, AN OLD FRIEND OF NEHRU'S AND A FIERY KASHMIRINATIONALIST, CONFUSED THINGS BY STARTING TO PROMOTE A LOCALINDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT . INDIA CLAPPED SHEIK ABDULLAH INTO JAIL IN 1953AND INTRODUCED A SERIES OF REPRESSIVE MEASURES TO HALT OTHERNATIONALIST OR PROPAKISTAN MOVEMENTS . EXCEPT FOR THREE MONTHS IN 1958,SHEIK ABDULLAH HAS LANGUISHED IN PRISON EVER SINCE, WAS LAST WEEK ONTRIAL ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT . NUDGE FROMTHE NORTH . THE IMPRISONMENT OF SHEIK ABDULLAH SYMBOLIZED ALL OFPAKISTAN'S DEEP DISTRUST OF NEHRU . DESPITE HIS OUTWARD DEVOTION TO THEU.N., NO AMOUNT OF U.N . PRESSURE COULD BRING NEHRU TO THE BARGAININGTABLE WITH PAKISTAN OVER KASHMIR . BUT WHEN RED CHINA THRUST DEEP INTOINDIA'S HIMALAYAN BORDERLAND LAST OCTOBER, NEHRU RELUCTANTLY YIELDED TOTHE INSISTENT ENVOYS OF THE U.S . AND BRITAIN WHO SUGGESTED THAT UNLESSINDIA AND PAKISTAN SETTLED THEIR DIFFERENCES, THERE WOULD BE LITTLEHOPE OF DEFENDING THE SUBCONTINENT AGAINST CHINESE AGGRESSION .HOTHEADED EXTREMISTS IN BOTH COUNTRIES OPPOSED THE IDEA OF TALKS .KASHMIR IS NOT FOR SALE, SCREAMED AN INDIAN HEADLINE ; IN PAKISTAN'SNATIONAL ASSEMBLY, POLITICIANS ARGUED THAT COMMUNISM WAS FAR LESS ANEVIL THAN " HINDU DOMINATION . " WHERE WAS THE ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION ?OFFICIALLY PAKISTAN MAINTAINED THAT AN OVERALL PLEBISCITE IS THE ONLYSOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM . BUT PRIVATELY PAKISTAN HAS FALLBACKPOSITIONS, IS WILLING TO HOLD REGIONAL REFERENDUMS THAT WOULD GIVEINDIA BOTH JAMMU AND LADAKH . THE REAL ISSUE, HOWEVER, WAS KASHMIR'SVALE . PAKISTAN SEEMED AGREEABLE TO THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THEIMPORTANT REGION . NEHRU, HOWEVER, FEARED THAT SECESSION OF ANY PART OFKASHMIR WOULD ENCOURAGE SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS IN OTHER INDIAN STATESWITH STRONG NATIONALIST TENDENCIES . NEVERTHELESS, INDIAN OFFICIALSSHOWED UP IN RAWALPINDI FOR THE START OF NEGOTIATIONS LAST WEEK . THEYWERE PREPARED FOR ALMOST ANY SURPRISE BUT THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY ARRIVED. ON THE EVE OF THE CONFERENCE, PAKISTAN SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED ANAGREEMENT " IN PRINCIPLE " WITH RED CHINA FOR A COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OFTHEIR MUTUAL BORDER DIFFERENCES . TO THE INDIANS IT WAS A STUNNINGBLOW, FOR IT SEEMED THAT THE PAKISTANIS WERE DELIBERATELY USING THECHINESE BOGEYMAN TO BLACKMAIL THEM INTO YIELDING BETTER TERMS ON THEKASHMIR QUESTION . AFTER TWO DAYS OF NO PROGRESS, THE RAWALPINDI TALKSWERE ADJOURNED FOR THREE WEEKS .
