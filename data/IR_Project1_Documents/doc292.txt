WORLD LAW " FOR CIVILIZED EXISTENCE " SOMEONE ONCE ASKED SOLONHOW JUSTICE COULD BE ACHIEVED IN ATHENS . " IT CAN BE ACHIEVED, "REPLIED THE GREAT LAWMAKER, IN SUBSTANCE, " IF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOTDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY A WRONG ARE JUST AS INDIGNANT ABOUT IT AS THOSEWHO ARE PERSONALLY HURT . " THIS GENERALIZED PASSION FOR JUSTICE HASALWAYS BEEN A HARD STANDARD TO LIVE UP TO, BUT U.S . CHIEF JUSTICE EARLWARREN CITED IT LAST WEEK TO SET THE THEME FOR A MAJOR INTERNATIONALMEETING OF JURISTS THAT CONVENED LAST WEEK IN SOLON'S CITY . FORMALTITLE : " FIRST WORLD CONFERENCE ON WORLD PEACE THROUGH LAW . "CEREMONIALLY WELCOMED BY THE KING AND QUEEN OF GREECE IN THE MARBLEHALLS OF THE ATHENS HILTON WERE 1,000 JURISTS FROM 105 NATIONS . THECONFERENCE WAS THE CULMINATION OF A MOVEMENT LAUNCHED FIVE YEARS AGO BYWORLD-LAWMAN CHARLES SYLVANUS RHYNE, PAST PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN BARASSOCIATION, AND FOLLOWED A SERIES OF PREPARATORY SESSIONS IN COSTARICA,JAPAN, NIGERIA AND ITALY . SAID RHYNE IN HIS KEYNOTEADDRESS : " WE SHARE ONE GREAT IDEAL WHICH TRANSCENDS OUR DIVERSITY ABELIEF THAT IN THE RULE OF LAW LIES THE ROUTE TO WORLD PEACE . " WORLDLAW, RHYNE CAUTIONED, SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS " A DRAMATIC PANACEAOR CURE-ALL FOR THE WORLD'S ILLS, BUT RATHER A PATIENT LABOR DEMANDINGIMMENSE AND CONSTANT EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE TRUE BASIS FOR CIVILIZEDPROGRESS AND EXISTENCE . " SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS . HENRY R . LUCE,EDITOR IN CHIEF OF TIME INC., RECALLED THE BIBLICAL PASSAGE, " BLESSEDARE THE PEACEMAKERS " AND POINTED OUT :PEACE HAS TO BE MADE . PEACE CANNOT MERELY BE KEPT NOT FORLONG BY FORCE OF ARMS . NEITHER WILL PEACE BE GIVEN TO US AS ANUNDESERVED GIFT FROM HEAVEN . OVERWHELMINGLY, PEACE IS THE WORK OFJUSTICE, AND THE WORK OF JUSTICE IS MAINLY THE WORK OF THE LAW . " LUCEURGED HIS LISTENERS TO CARRY THE CASE FOR WORLD LAW " TO ALLPOLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD . " SAID HE : " SOFAR AS I KNOW, NO PRESIDENT OR PRIME MINISTER HAS PUT THE RULE OF LAWAT THE TOP OF HIS POLITICAL BANNER, " BUT THE " RULE OF LAW CAN BECOMEGOOD POLITICS . " IN SIX DAYS OF DELIBERATIONS, THE JURISTS MODESTLYBEGAN " THE WORK OF THE LAW " BY SURVEYING THE WORLD'S EXISTING LEGALFRAMEWORK AND MAKING SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT . MAIN CONCLUSIONS : .THEUNITED NATIONS . REALLY TO BE " MANKIND'S BEST HOPE FOR A PEACEFULWORLD, " IT NEEDS MORE MUSCLE . U.N . PEACE-KEEPING EFFORTS SHOULD BECODIFIED, A PERMANENT " PEACE POLICE FORCE " CREATED, AND THE SECURITYCOUNCIL ENLARGED . THE CONFERENCE RECOMMENDED PARTIAL ABOLITION OF THEVETO : HENCEFORTH IT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED WHEN A DISPUTE CAN BESETTLED PEACEFULLY . BUT THERE WAS PLAINLY NO DESIRE TO GET INVOLVED INTHE TOUCHY ISSUE OF U.N . FINANCING . .THE WORLD COURT . WITH MOSTSTATES (THE U.S . INCLUDED) RESERVING THE RIGHT TO IGNORE ITSJURISDICTION, IT HAS RENDERED ONLY 13 FINAL VERDICTS IN ITS 18 YEARS .MORE NATIONS SHOULD BOW TO IT, SUGGESTED THE ATHENS MEETING . THE COURTSHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO HEAR CASES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS STATES; AND THE POSSIBILITY OF " REGIONAL WORLD COURTS " SHOULD BE EXPLORED. .FOREIGN INVESTMENT & TRADE . BOTH SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY A FRAMEWORKOF MORE EFFICIENT LAW . STATUTES ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT SHOULD BECODIFIED, AND SPECIAL COURTS CONSIDERED FOR SETTLING DISPUTES .NATIONAL COMMITTEES OF LAWYERS SHOULD BE SET UP TO STUDY THE LEGALMACHINERY FOR TRADE, AND IMPROVED POLICING OF INTERNATIONAL PATENTS . .SPACE . THE NEWEST FRONTIER PROVOKED MORE QUESTIONS THANRECOMMENDATIONS . WHERE DOES AIRSPACE (OVER WHICH NATIONS EXERTSOVEREIGNTY) END, AND OUTER SPACE (WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS YET CLAIMED)BEGIN ? ARE THE MOON AND PLANETS OPEN DOMAIN LIKE COLUMBUS' NEWWORLD, WHERE THE HOISTING OF FLAG AND CROSS WAS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISHSOVEREIGNTY ? ON THE LATTER, THE CONFERENCE SAID NO THAT THE U.N .SHOULD BE GRANTED SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL OBJECTS OF OUTER SPACE, NOMATTER WHICH NATION'S SPACESHIPS LAND ON THEM FIRST . DELEGATES FURTHERSUGGESTED ADOPTION OF " THE PRINCIPLE OF LIABILITY FOR INJURY FROMSPACE ACCIDENTS, " URGED AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO FORGE A BODY OFSPACE LAW . SALVATION PROCLAMATION . AT WEEK'S END, THESE SIMILARTOPICS WERE ADOPTED AS A " GLOBAL WORK PROGRAM . " THE JURISTS ALSO 1)AGREED TO FOUND A WORLD PEACE THROUGH LAW CENTER, TO BE ORGANIZED BYRHYNE, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A RESEARCH CLEARINGHOUSE FOR ALL THE WORLD'SLEGAL SYSTEMS, 2) SET IN MOTION PLANS FOR A WORLD RULE OF LAW YEAR, 3)DREW UP A " PROCLAMATION OF ATHENS, " STATING THEIR CASE BEFORE WORLDOPINION . " THIS CONFERENCE, " SAID THE PROCLAMATION, " BEING DEEPLYCONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ININTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CAN ONLY LEAD TO DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND THROUGHNUCLEAR HOLOCAUST, HEREBY PROCLAIMS THAT LAW MUST REPLACE FORCE AS THECONTROLLING FACTOR IN THE FATE OF HUMANITY . " ONE MEASURE OF THEDIFFICULTY OF THAT TASK : ALTHOUGH INVITATIONS WENT TO ALL COMMUNISTCOUNTRIES, NONE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YUGOSLAVIA) SENT DELEGATIONS TOATHENS .
