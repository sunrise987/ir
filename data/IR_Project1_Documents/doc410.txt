KENYA UHURU IS NOT ENOUGH THE YOUTH RALLY AT NAIROBILAST WEEK WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF FOUR RANGYAFRICANS . EACH WAS CLAD IN ANIMAL SKINS, ARMED WITH SHARP-BLADEDPANGAS AND WEARING HIS HAIR IN LONG BRAIDS SMEARED WITH RED MUD THEFIGHTING INSIGNIA OF THE MAU MAU TERRORISTS . THE CROWD FELL SILENT ASTHE FOUR APPROACHED THE DAIS WHERE SAT PRIME MINISTER JOMO KENYATTA ANDHIS HONORED GUEST, PRINCE PHILIP, HUSBAND OF BRITAIN'S QUEEN ELIZABETH. WITH HIS LUMBERING, ELEPHANT WALK, KENYATTA DESCENDED FROM THE DAIS,PUSHED THROUGH HIS STARTLED SECURITY GUARDS, AND GREETED THE MAU MAU ./ KENYA IS FREE NOW, " HE SAID . " THERE IS NO NEED TO HIDE OR FIGHT ./ PEACEFULLY, THE FOUR MEN SURRENDERED THEIR WEAPONS . THE CEREMONY .ALTHOUGH KENYA'S VICIOUS MAU MAU LONG AGO STOPPED FIGHTING, MANY WERESTILL HIDING OUT IN THE GREEN-BLACK FORESTS ON THE SLOPES OF MOUNTKENYA . ALL WEEK THEY DRIFTED BACK " FIELD MARSHAL " MWARIAMA AND 50ASSORTED " GENERALS . " THE FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVING ALONG WITHTHE MAU MAU RANGED FROM RED CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER CHEN YI TO INDIA'SINDIRA GANDHI AND U.S . INTERIOR SECRETARY STEWART UDALL . ALSO FROMTHE U.S., AS GUESTS AND ENTERTAINERS, CAME HARRY BELAFONTE AND MIRIAMMAKEBA. THERE WERE BALLS, GARDEN PARTIES, RECEPTIONS, THE LAYING OFCORNERSTONES, AND THE PRESENTATION OF GIFTS . QUEEN ELIZABETH GAVEKENYATTA THE ROYAL LODGE AT SAGANA ; THE AGA KHAN TURNED OVER TO HIMHIS OWN FORMER RESIDENCE ; A GROUP OF U.S . BUSINESSMEN DONATED AWHITE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL . THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN KENYATTA GOT INTO HISNEW CAR AND WAS DRIVEN TO UHURU STADIUM . AT FIVE MINUTES BEFOREMIDNIGHT, AS KENYATTA ROSE TO TAKE PART IN THE FLAG-RAISING CEREMONY,PRINCE PHILIP WHISPERED JOKINGLY TO HIM, " ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'TLIKE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND NOW ? " SMILING, KENYATTA SHOOK HIS HEADAND, ACCOMPANIED BY BRITAIN'S GOVERNOR MALCOLM MACDONALD (WHO WILL STAYON AS GOVERNOR-GENERAL), WALKED TO THE TWO FLAGPOLES IN THE CENTER OFTHE STADIUM . IN ORDER TO SPARE BRITISH ONLOOKERS ALL POSSIBLE ANGUISH,KENYATTA HAD TACTFULLY ORDERED THAT THE LIGHTS BE DIMMED DURING THEMOMENT THE UNION JACK WAS LOWERED, AND THEN BLAZED ON AGAIN AS KENYA'SFLAG WAS RAISED . THE NEW BANNER : BLACK FOR THE PEOPLE, RED FOR THEBLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED, AND GREEN FOR THE LAND, WITH THIN WHITE LINESINSERTED BETWEEN THE COLORS . THE WHITE, SAYS KENYATTA, IS TO ENSURETHAT THE FLAG REPRESENTS ALL KENYANS . SLOWLY THE BANNER OF AFRICA'S35TH NEW STATE UNFURLED TO WILD CRIES OF " UHURU ! " AND THEEXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS . MINUTES LATER, WORD REACHED THE STADIUM THAT ATEAM OF CLIMBERS HAD REACHED THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT KENYA, PLANTED THE NEWFLAG AND LIT FLARES THAT ILLUMINATED THE SACRED MOUNTAIN " LIKE AFIREBALL . " THE PROBLEMS . DESPITE HIS ESTIMATED 73 YEARS (HE CLAIMSNOT TO BE SURE OF HIS BIRTH DATE), AND FREQUENT SIGNS OF FATIGUE,KENYATTA IS STILL TALL AND BROADSHOULDERED, HIS EYES HUGE AND PIERCING. IN HIS TIME HE HAS BEEN A FARM BOY, STUDENT, LABORER, METER-READER,RESPECTED ANTHROPOLOGIST, HEADMASTER, CONVICTED TERRORIST AND, FORDECADES, THE UNPARALLELED IDOL OF MILLIONS OF AFRICANS . THE COUNTRY HENOW RULES CARRIES MOST OF ITS OLD ILLS INTO INDEPENDENCE . ABROAD, THEMOST IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS A VIOLENT QUARREL WITH KENYA'S NORTHEASTERNNEIGHBOR, SOMALIA, WHICH LAYS CLAIM TO THE BARREN BUT EXTENSIVENORTHEASTERN REGION, INHABITED BY 200,000 SOMALIS (SEE MAP) . TODIMINISH SUCH QUARRELS, KENYA IS EARNESTLY PUSHING AN EAST AFRICANFEDERATION OF KENYA WITH TANGANYIKA AND UGANDA, WHICH WOULD CREATE ANATION OF 25 MILLION PEOPLE AND MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE EXTENDED TO SUCHSMALL STATES AS ZANZIBAR, NYASALAND, RWANDA AND BURUNDI .INTERNATIONALLY, KENYA WILL, OF COURSE, BE NEUTRALIST AND ACCEPT AIDFROM BOTH EAST AND WEST .INDEPENDENCE BROUGHT ABOUT AREUNION OF KENYATTA'S FAR-FLUNG FAMILIES . HIS ENGLISH THIRD WIFE, EDNAMAY, AND HER 20-YEAR-OLD SON PETER, A CAMBRIDGE UNDERGRADUATE, FLEW TONAIROBI AND WERE MET BY KENYATTA'S FOURTH WIFE, NGINA, AN AFRICAN, ANDHIS DAUGHTERS MARGARET, 34, AND JANE, 14, BY HIS FIRST WIFE GRACE, ALSOAN AFRICAN . HIS SECOND WIFE, WHOSE NAME KENYATTA REFUSES TO DIVULGE,IS SAID TO HAVE DIED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO .KENYATTA HIMSELF HAS HARDLY SHOWNANY COMMUNIST SYMPATHIES, BUT HIS HOME MINISTER, OGINGA ODINGA, IS ALEFT-WINGER WHO HAS ALREADY SET UP A STATE NEWS AGENCY WITH RUSSIAN ANDCZECH HELP . HE IS PERHAPS BALANCED BY JUSTICE MINISTER TOM MBOYA, WHOIS AT PRESENT POLITICALLY IN THE SHADE, BUT REMAINS STRONGLYNATIONALIST AND GENERALLY PRO-WESTERN . AT HOME, KENYATTA MUST RECKONWITH A POPULATION THAT IS SOARING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.4 PER CENT ,AND THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS WITHIN FIVE YEARS TO SETTLE 50,000AFRICAN FAMILIES ON A MILLION ACRES IN THE " WHITE HIGHLANDS " BOUGHTFROM EUROPEAN SETTLERS WITH $80 MILLION SUPPLIED BY BRITAIN, BY THATTIME AN ADDITIONAL 100,000 FAMILIES WILL BE CLAMORING FOR LAND .KENYA'S HUGE LABOR SURPLUS MUST IDLY AWAIT THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OFINDUSTRY, AND THERE IS A GREAT LACK OF TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO REPLACETHE DEPARTING WHITES . FOR EXAMPLE, KENYA HAS 750 DOCTORS BUT NEEDS ATLEAST 9,000 . THE OUTLOOK . PAINSTAKINGLY, KENYATTA PLEADS WITH HISPEOPLE TO ACCEPT HARAMBEE, A SWAHILI WORD MEANING " PULL TOGETHER . "HE TELLS AFRICANS THAT THEY MUST CONCEDE FULL PARTNERSHIP TO WHITES ANDASIANS, AND TELLS HIS OWN DOMINANT KIKUYU TRIBE THAT THEY MUST WORKAMIABLY WITH OTHER TRIBES . THE OPPOSITION KADU PARTY, WHICH ELECTEDONLY 31 OF THE 130-MEMBER HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS FALLING APART ASMORE AND MORE OF ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES CLIMB ON THE KENYATTABANDWAGON, LURED BY GOVERNMENT JOBS AND PATRONAGE . AS A RESULT, KENYAWILL PROBABLY BECOME A TYPICALLY AFRICAN ONE-PARTY STATE, BUT PROBABLYNOT IN SO VIRULENT A FORM AS GHANA OR GUINEA . NO ONE CAN IGNORE THEDIFFICULTIES AHEAD THE UNEASINESS OF THE REMAINING WHITE SETTLERS, THEFEARS OF THE ASIANS WHO CONTROL MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE, THEAGE-OLD TRIBAL RIVALRIES THAT COULD EXPLODE INTO SEPARATISM OR TRIBALWAR . BUT THE DEPARTING BRITISH ARE GREATLY IMPRESSED BY KENYATTA'SGROWING STATESMANSHIP . " ONLY WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES, " HE TOLD HISPEOPLE LAST WEEK . " NOBODY ELSE CAN SAVE US . IN THE PAST WE HAVEBLAMED THE ENGLISHMAN WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG . WE SAID HE WAS SUCKINGOUR BLOOD . NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS OURS, AND NOW YOU WILL BLAME KENYATTA. BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT KENYATTA, BY HIMSELF, CANNOT GIVE YOUANYTHING . I URGE YOU TO WORK HARD SO THAT OUR UHURU WILL BE MEANINGFUL. FROM TODAY ON, OUR MOTTO WILL BE " UHURU NA KAZI (FREEDOM AND WORK) .
