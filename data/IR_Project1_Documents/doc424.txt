SOUTH KOREA FATIGUES TO FLANNELS SEOUL WAS DECKED IN ALLITS FESTIVE FINERY LAST WEEK AS SOUTH KOREA OBSERVED THE END OF TWOYEARS, SEVEN MONTHS AND ONE DAY OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP . BUSES WEREGARLANDED WITH WREATHS AND NEWLY MADE FLAGS DECORATED STOREFRONTS ANDSTREETCARS . THE MIDNIGHT CURFEW WAS LIFTED FOR THE DAY, AND 5,000PRISON INMATES WERE RELEASED ON AMNESTY . IN A BONE-CHILLING DRIZZLEBEFORE THE NATIONAL CAPITOL BUILDING, 15,000 SHIVERING SPECTATORSWATCHED FORMER MILITARY STRONGMAN GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, 46, TAKE THEOATH OF OFFICE AS SOUTH KOREA'S FIFTH CIVILIAN PRESIDENT . PROMISINGNEVER " TO PERMIT THE RESURGENCE OF DICTATORSHIP UNDER ANY DISGUISE ORPRETEXT, " PARK SAID :. " THE BRIGHT MORNING OF THE NEW REPUBLIC HASDAWNED . LET US PUT DEPRESSION, MELANCHOLY, CONFUSION AND PESSIMISMBEHIND US AND CREATE A NEW HISTORY OF OPTIMISM AND DETERMINATION . "DESPITE PARK'S RINGING WORDS, THE ONLY REAL CHANGE IN SOUTH KOREA'SGOVERNMENT IS FROM MILITARY FATIGUES TO CIVILIAN FLANNELS . UNDER THENEW CONSTITUTION, THE PRESIDENT HAS ALMOST DICTATORIAL POWERS, ANDTHOUGH PARK'S DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTY GARNERED ONLY 34 PER CENT OFTHE VOTE IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS, THE OPPOSITION WAS SOSPLIT THAT THE D.R.P . HAS A WHOPPING, 45-SEAT PARLIAMENTARY PLURALITY. THOUGH PARK PLEADED FOR NATIONAL UNITY, OPPOSITION LEADER YUN PO SUN,WHO BARELY LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BOYCOTTED THE ASSEMBLY'SOPENING SESSION, AND OTHER DISSIDENT ASSEMBLYMEN THREATENED TOINVESTIGATE THE CORRUPTION PREVALENT UNDER PARK'S MILITARY JUNTA . FARMORE MENACING TO PARK IS SOUTH KOREA'S CHAOTIC ECONOMY . IN THE PASTYEAR, RETAIL PRICES HAVE CLIMBED 40 PERCENT, AND SOME 10 PER CENTOF THE LABOR FORCE IS UNEMPLOYED . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HAVEPLUMMETED TO $105 MILLION . DESPERATE FOR A NEW DOLLOP OF U.S .ECONOMIC AID, PARK INVITED A U.S . CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO HISINNAUGURATION . BUT THE U.S . HAS SLASHED NEXT YEAR'S TOTAL AIDCOMMITMENT BY $54 MILLION TO $236 MILLION, HOPES TO PRESSURE PARK INTOSTABILIZING THE ECONOMY . A CONTINUING DICTATORSHIP IN SOUTH KOREA ISNOT VERY PALATABLE TO THE U.S . BUT WITH HIS DICTATORIAL POWERS, PARKCAN AT LEAST PROMISE A DEGREE OF POLITICAL STABILITY .
