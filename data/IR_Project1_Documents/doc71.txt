GREAT BRITAIN 2-12 THE OTHER HAROLD THE LABOR PARTY LAST WEEK CHOSE ANEW LEADER TO CARRY ITS BANNER AGAINST THE TORIES IN BRITAIN'S COMINGGENERAL ELECTION . THE WINNER : HAROLD WILSON, 46, A PIPE-SMOKINGINTELLECTUAL WITH A PHENOMENAL MEMORY, A FOLLOWING OF MIXED ADMIRERS,AND A LOVE OF POLITICAL COMBAT . WILSON'S  VICTORY WAS A CRUSHING BLOWTO HIS CHIEF RIVAL, COMRADELY GEORGE BROWN, 48, A STAUNCH TRADEUNIONIST AND EX-TRUCK DRIVER, WHO AS ACTING PARTY LEADER SINCE THEDEATH LAST MONTH OF HUGH GAITSKELL, HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HEWOULD INHERIT THE MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP . BUT WHEN THE VOTING BEGAN LASTWEEK, IT WAS GEORGE BROWN'S OLD FRIENDS AMONG LABOR'S TRADE UNIONISTSWHO ABANDONED HIM FIRST . SOME OPPOSED HIS PRO-COMMON MARKET VIEWS ;OTHERS AMONG LABOR'S INTELLECTUAL CENTER AND RIGHT FLINCHED AT THETHOUGHT OF A WORKINGCLASS, UP-FROM-THE-RANKS PRIME MINISTER, ANDPREFERRED TO GO TO THE COUNTRY WITH AN OXFORD GRADUATE AND ECONOMICSDON LIKE WILSON . RESPECTABILITY MEANS A LOT TO THE LABOR PARTY . HIGHMORTALITY . " NO ONE KNOWS HAROLD, REALLY, " SAYS A FRIEND . BUT AT APRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, JAMMED WITH REPORTERS AND TV CAMERAS,WILSON SET OUT SMOOTHLY AND COMPETENTLY TO LEAVE THE RIGHT IMPRESSION .HE REGRETTED THE " TRAGIC EVENT " OF GAITSKELL'S DEATH " THAT CREATEDTHIS VACANCY . " HE DIPLOMATICALLY DECLARED THAT " A GREAT DEAL OFCREDIT MUST GO TO GEORGE BROWN " FOR KEEPING THE PARTY TOGETHER IN THEINTERIM . FINALLY, WILSON STATED HIS THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES : " FIRST,TO MAINTAIN THE UNITY OF THE PARTY THAT HUGH GAITSKELL HANDED ON ;SECOND, TO CONTINUE THOSE POLICIES WORKED OUT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP . . .THIRDLY, TO LEAD THE PARTY TO VICTORY IN THE COMING GENERAL ELECTION ./ IN THE PAST DECADE, LABOR'S STRENGTH HAS BEEN SAPPED BY INTERNALBICKERING AND BY THE LOSS OF MANY OF ITS ABLEST MEN (GAITSKELL, SIRSTAFFORD CRIPPS, ERNEST BEVIN, ANEURIN BEVAN) . THE FEUDING HAS FADED,AND LABOR FINDS ITSELF IN THE BEST SHAPE IN YEARS TO TOPPLE THEGOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN . A GALLUP POLL LAST WEEKINDICATED THAT LABOR HAD A 15F PER CENT LEAD OVER THE CONSERVATIVES,THE LOWEST THE TORIES HAVE BEEN IN ELEVEN YEARS IN POWER . BEVERIDGE'SBOY . DEEPENING UNEMPLOYMENT AND A FALTERING ECONOMY ACCOUNT MORE FORTORY UNPOPULARITY THAN ITS RECENT DEFEAT ON THE COMMON MARKET .MACMILLAN HAS UNTIL FALL 1964 TO CALL AN ELECTION AT THE TIME MOSTADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF . MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE SKILL WITH WHICHWILSON EXPLOITS TORY WEAKNESSES AND DEMONSTRATES LABOR'S RIGHT TOGOVERN . THE SON OF AN INDUSTRIAL CHEMIST, JAMES HAROLD WILSON WAS BORNMARCH 11, 1916, IN THE HEART OF INDUSTRIAL YORKSHIRE, AND SPENT HISCHILDHOOD IN A HILLSIDE VILLAGE OVERLOOKING THE FACTORY SMOKE OF THECOLNE VALLEY . AT THE LOCAL COUNCIL SCHOOL, HE WON THE FIRST OF ASERIES OF SCHOLARSHIPS THAT EVENTUALLY CARRIED HIM TO OXFORD'S JESUSCOLLEGE, WHERE HE WAS A LEADING MEMBER OF THE DEBATING SOCIETY AND ACROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER . GRADUATING WITH FIRST CLASS HONORS, WILSONREMAINED AT OXFORD AS AN ECONOMICS DON UNTIL THE WAR, ENDING UP IN THEMINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER . SIR WILLIAM BEVERIDGE EMPLOYED HIM AS ARESEARCHER FOR HIS FAMED SOCIAL INSURANCE REPORT, AND CALLED WILSON A "BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN " AND " THE BEST ECONOMIST I'VE EVER HAD . " IN1945 WILSON STOOD FOR OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND, IN THE ELECTIONTHAT THREW WINSTON CHURCHILL OUT OF OFFICE, WON A LANCASHIRE SEATHANDILY BY 7,022 VOTES . TWO YEARS LATER, WHEN WILSON BECAME PRESIDENTOF THE BOARD OF TRADE AT 31, HE WAS THE YOUNGEST CABINET MEMBER SINCEWILLIAM PITT . LITTERED HOUSE . AMONG HIS CONSTITUENTS OR AT HISRED-BRICK HOME IN HAMPSTEAD GARDEN SUBURB, WILSON IS AFFABLE, EASYGOINGAND WELL-LIKED . HIS WIFE MARY, THE DAUGHTER OF A BAPTIST MINISTER,WRITES POETRY AND IS ACTIVE IN HER LOCAL CHURCH ; HIS TWO SONS, ROBIN,19, AND GILES, 14, LITTER THE HOUSE WITH SPORTS GEAR AND MACKINTOSHES .BUT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE REACTION TO WILSON IS GENERALLY ONE OFUNEASY SUSPICION, AND HE IS FREQUENTLY ACCUSED OF BEING " SLIPPERY . "AS THE ECONOMIST PUT IT LAST WEEK, " ON THE BIG THINGS DEFENSE, THEAMERICAN ALLIANCE, EAST-WEST, THE NEED TO GIVE LABOR A TWENTIETHCENTURY LOOK MR . WILSON HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY AMBIGUOUS, INDEEDDELIBERATELY AND CLEVERLY SO . THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR MORE THANDOUBT ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP . " HAVING QUIT THE LABOR CABINET IN 1951,ALONG WITH FIREBRAND ANEURIN BEVAN, WILSON HAS INHERITED MUCH OFBEVAN'S LEFTWING SUPPORT . BUT IN THE CABINET HIS MAIN ADMINISTRATIVEACHIEVEMENT WAS THE DISMANTLING OF A VAST ARRAY OF CONTROLS ONBRITAIN'S POSTWAR ECONOMY . HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE PRAGMATIC THANDOCTRINAIRE OR OPPORTUNISTIC, HIS ENEMIES SAY . IN A COMMONS SPEECHLAST WEEK HE DECLARED, " WHAT I AM SAYING MAY OR MAY NOT BEIDEOLOGICAL, BUT IT WILL GET THE EXPORT ORDERS . " WITH THE LEFT SAFELYON HIS SIDE, WILSON IS SHREWD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT, AS LEADER, HE MUSTNOW CONCILIATE THE PARTY'S CENTER AND RIGHT . WILSON CARRIED ON A MILDFLIRTATION WITH THE H-BOMB " UNILATERALISTS " WHEN HE CHALLENGEDGAITSKELL FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP IN 1960, AND FOR A TIME PLUMPED FORNEUTRALISM INSTEAD OF NATO . LAST WEEK WILSON REASSURED EVERYBODY THATTHE LABOR PARTY " STANDS FIRMLY BY NATO . " AND HE ADDED, " WE SHOULDEXPECT TO HAVE A VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP " WITH WASHINGTON . IN ARECENT COMMONS SPEECH HE ARGUED THAT BRITAIN SHOULD AVOID THE NEEDLESSEXPENSE OF A SEPARATE NUCLEAR DETERRENT, BUT NEVERTHELESS SHOULD HAVE AVOICE IN DECIDING WHEN THE WEST (I.E., THE U.S.) USES ITS NUCLEAR POWER: " THERE MUST BE NO ANNIHILATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ! " WITHHIS READY TONGUE AND SHARP MIND, HAROLD WILSON WILL PROVE A FORMIDABLEADVERSARY FOR PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN (HE WAS SWIFTLY DUBBED "THE OTHER HAROLD " ) . THERE IS HARDLY AN M.P . WHO HAS A BETTER GRASPOF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE OR A BETTER KNACK OF TURNING IT TO HISSIDE'S ADVANTAGE . HE HAS ALREADY DRAWN BLOOD WITH HIS SLASHING ATTACKSON THE " VAIN NUCLEAR POSTURING " OF THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT .MACMILLAN'S RELATIONS WITH U.S . PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY, SAID WILSON,REMINDED HIM OF A " SEEDY UNCLE " RECEIVING HOMILIES FROM A YOUNG ANDWEALTHY NEPHEW . THOUGH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER PRECISELY WHEREHAROLD WILSON STANDS, THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT LAST WEEK ABOUT WHERE HEINTENDS TO COME TO REST AT 10 DOWNING STREET .
