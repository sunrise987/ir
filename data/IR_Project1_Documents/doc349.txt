SOUTH VIET NAM REPORT ON THE WAR OVERSHADOWEDBY THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC TURMOIL IN SAIGON, THE ALL BUTFORGOTTEN WAR AGAINST THE VIET CONG CONTINUES ON ITS UGLY, BLOODY ANDWEARISOME COURSE . THE DRIVE AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS HAS NOT DIMINISHEDIN RECENT WEEKS ; IN FACT, IT HAS INTENSIFIED . FEARS THAT THEBUDDHIST CONTROVERSY MIGHT DAMAGE MORALE AMONG VIETNAMESE TROOPS HAVESO FAR BEEN GROUNDLESS . IF LAST WEEK'S BATTLES WERE ANY CRITERION, THEGOVERNMENT SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING BETTER THAN EVER AGAINST A COMMUNISTFOE THAT IS EXACTING A HIDEOUS PRICE IN BLOOD IN THE FLOODED PADDIES OFTHE SOUTH . THE BIGGEST GOVERNMENT VICTORY IN MONTHS CAME LAST WEEKNEAR THE TOWN OF GOCONG, 45 MILES SOUTH OF SAIGON . IN THE DEAD OFNIGHT, 500 VIET CONG REGULARS SWOOPED DOWN ON A STRATEGIC HAMLET UNDERA SCREEN OF SUPPORTING FIRE FROM HEAVY MACHINE GUNS AND RECOILLESSRIFLES . DESPERATELY CALLING FOR HELP OVER THEIR RADIO, THE DEFENDERSFOUGHT BACK DOGGEDLY, BUT WERE BARELY HOLDING OUT WHEN A GOVERNMENTINFANTRY RELIEF COLUMN ARRIVED AT DAWN WITH 15 ARMORED PERSONNELCARRIERS . AMBUSHED BY THE REDS, THE GOVERNMENT REINFORCEMENTS DID NOTPANIC, NOSED THEIR PERSONNEL CARRIERS OFF THE ROAD AND INTO THEPADDIES, HEADING DIRECTLY FOR THE DUGIN REDS . FROM A GRAVEYARD AT THEFRINGE OF THE BATTLEFIELD, A VIET CONG HEAVY MACHINE GUN KNOCKED OUT ANAPC . BUT SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT AIR FORCE PLANES, WHICH SWEPT OVERTHE RED POSITIONS IN SCREAMING, SHALLOW DIVES FIRING ROCKETS ANDDROPPING NAPALM, THE REINFORCEMENTS ROLLED STRAIGHT ONTO THE REDS,MASHING SCORES OF THE COMMUNIST TROOPS INTO THE STINKING PADDY MUD WITHTHEIR HUGE STEEL TREADS . AT LAST THE REDS BROKE AND RAN, LEAVINGBEHIND 83 DEAD . MUTILATED BODIES . THE EPISODE MADE NO SIZABLE DENT INTHE VIET CONG ARMY . BUT IT WAS HEARTENING TO U.S . MILITARY OBSERVERS,WHO ON MANY PAST OCCASIONS HAD WATCHED THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS REFUSETO PRESS THEIR ATTACK . THIS TIME THE RELIEF COLUMN HAD STOOD ITSGROUND UNDER THE VIET CONG POUNDING AND THEN MOVED IN ON THE REDS INBRUTAL COMBAT . TWO DAYS LATER, THE REDS EVENED THE SCORE . THIS TIMETHEY HIT THE RICE-RICH CAMAU PENINSULA, TRADITIONALLYCOMMUNIST-CONTROLLED TERRITORY WHERE GOVERNMENT ENCLAVES ARE ONLYISLANDS IN A SEA OF VIET CONG . THE PLAN WAS A CLEVER TWO-PRONGEDATTACK AGAINST THE TWO GOVERNMENT-HELD CITIES OF CAI NUOC AND DAMDOI,WHICH LIE 15 MILES APART ON THE SOUTHERNMOST TIP OF VIET NAM . TOCONFUSE GOVERNMENT REINFORCEMENTS AND TO HAMPER THEIR SPEEDY ARRIVAL,THE VIET CONG FIRST FEINTED AT THREE NEIGHBORING OUTPOSTS, SOWED MINESON A MAJOR ROAD OVER WHICH GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAD TO TRAVEL, AND POUREDHARASSING MORTAR FIRE ON A U.S . HELICOPTER AIRSTRIP IN THE AREA .THE MILITARY FRONT SEEMED A MILLIONMILES FROM SAIGON LAST WEEK . FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE CRACKDOWN ON SOUTHVIET NAM'S BUDDHIST OPPOSITION, AN ATMOSPHERE OF WATCHFUL WAITING HUNGOVER THE CITY . STILL FEARFUL OF A COUP, THE GOVERNMENT STATIONEDSECRET POLICE OUTSIDE THE HOMES OF SUSPECT OFFICIALS ; TOP MILITARYOFFICERS WERE ORDERED TO SLEEP AT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS SO THAT A CHECKCOULD BE KEPT ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS . WITH THE BUDDHIST OPPOSITIONLULLED FOR THE MOMENT, SAIGON'S STUDENT POPULATION FEEBLY TRIED TORAISE PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . PELTED WITH CHAIRS AND DESKSTHROWN FROM CLASSROOM WINDOWS, GOVERNMENT TROOPS CLOSED MANY OFSAIGON'S SCHOOLS, THREW NEARLY 1,000 STUDENTS INTO JAIL TO COOL OFF .IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT VIET CONG AGENTS INSPIRED MUCH OF THEDEMONSTRATING . THIS MADE IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE U.S . ANDPRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM TO SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES . THE LATESTEPISODES OFFERED LITTLE ASSURANCE OF THAT . COUCHING HIS WORDS IN THEMOST CAREFUL DIPLOMATIC TERMS, U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE LASTWEEK SUGGESTED TO DIEM THAT HIS BROTHER AND FIERY SISTER-IN-LAW, NGODINH NHU AND MME . NHU, LEAVE THE COUNTRY UNTIL THE CURRENT CRISIS WASOVER AND A FRESH RAPPROCHEMENTSHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, THE REDS HIT CAINUOC DIRECTLY . POURING MORTAR SHELLS AND RECOILLESS RIFLE FIRE IN THEPERIMETER SYSTEM OF DEFENSIVE BUNKERS, THE VIET CONG BREACHED THE FRONTGATE OF THE CITY'S MAJOR OUTPOST, RAN FROM BUNKER TO BUNKER LOBBING INGRENADES AND SHOOTING THE DEFENDERS IN THE BACK . THE FIGHT LASTED FORONLY 35 MINUTES, BUT THE REDS OCCUPIED THE TOWN FOR THE NEXT 17 HOURS .IT WAS A BLOODBATH . WHEN REINFORCEMENTS FINALLY APPEARED, THEY FOUND AHEAP OF 50 MUTILATED BODIES, INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN, WHICH THEREDS HAD SET AFIRE . OF THE 100-MAN DEFENDING FORCE, ONLY 25 SURVIVED .EXPERTS DIFFER . SOON THEREAFTER, THE REDS OVERRAN THE NEIGHBORING TOWNOF DAMDOI . BUT THIS TIME THE COMMUNISTS MADE THE MISTAKE OF STAYINGTOO LONG . SEVEN HOURS AFTER THE VIET CONG OCCUPIED THE TOWN,GOVERNMENT MARINES, AIRLIFTED TO THE SCENE IN U.S . HELICOPTERS,COUNTERATTACKED . HALF THE MARINE FORCE BLOCKED THE REDS' ESCAPE ROUTEAND ATTACKED THEIR SANDBAGGED POSITIONS . ARMED HELICOPTERS UNLOADEDSOME 80 ROCKETS INTO THE COMMUNIST DEFENSES, AND FIGHTER PLANES ZOOMEDIN AT TREETOP LEVEL WITH GUNS BLAZING . WHEN THE REDS FINALLYDISAPPEARED INTO THE PADDIES AFTER AN ALL-DAY FIGHT, THEY LEFT BEHIND60 DEAD   BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POPULATION ESTABLISHED. LODGE HINTED DELICATELY THAT THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE BITTERLYCONTROVERSIAL NHUS IN SOUTH VIET NAM NOT ONLY HAMPERED THE WAR EFFORTAGAINST THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG, BUT COULD ALSO " ENDANGER " U.S .CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS TO DIEM'S GOVERNMENT . DIEM EXPRESSEDSURPRISE AND SHOCK AT LODGE'S SUGGESTION, COLDLY TURNED IT DOWN ; HEMIGHT HAVE WONDERED HOW JOHN F . KENNEDY WOULD HAVE FELT IF VIET NAMHAD ASKED FOR THE EXILE OF BOBBY AND ETHEL . WHAT NEXT IN U.S . POLICY? IT WAS A TIME OF FRANTIC PONDERING AND FRANTIC DISCUSSION INWASHINGTON . SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WERE LUDICROUS : CUT OFF ALL AIDTO DIEM (WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY HAND THE COUNTRY TO THE COMMUNISTS) ;RUN THE SEVENTH FLEET UP TO THE COAST AND FORCE DIEM OUT OF POWER (ALSOSENSELESS, SINCE NO SUITABLE SUCCESSOR WAS VISIBLE) . NO ONE SEEMED TOBE DISCUSSING PERHAPS THE MOST SENSIBLE SOLUTION OF ALL : STOP ALL THEHALFWAY HINTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROMOTERS OF A COUP D'ETAT, AND GETON WITH THE DIFFICULT AND UNPALATABLE TASK OF WORKING WITH NGO DINHDIEM AND HIS FAMILY . FACED WITH A PROFUSION OF PROPOSALS FOR ACTION,PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS KEEPING HIS MIND OPEN . AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE,HE REFUSED ALL EFFORTS TO DRAG HIM INTO A DISCUSSIONTHE GOVERNMENT'SMARINES WERE ALSO BADLY BATTERED ; 48 WERE KILLED BY THE TIME THESHOOTING STOPPED . ON THE BASIS OF BODIES, THIS MIGHT BE CALLED AGOVERNMENT VICTORY . NOT SO INSIST SOME AMERICAN MILITARY MEN WHO ARGUETHAT SUCH DEFENSIVE RESPONSES WHATEVER THE PENALTY IN LIVES TO THECOMMUNIST ENEMY ARE WASTING THE STRENGTH OF THE VIETNAMESE FORCES ASWELL AS THE $1,500,000 A DAY THE U.S . IS PUMPING INTO THE COUNTRY .THESE EXPERTS WILL NOT BE HAPPY UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT CAN ORGANIZEREGULAR " SEARCH AND HOLD " OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN RICE COUNTRY,COMMUNISM'S STRONGHOLD . IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TASK . THOUGHTHE VIET CONG ARE LOSING MORE MEN (CURRENTLY ABOUT 500 A WEEK) ALL THETIME, THERE ARE MORE TO BE KILLED ,; OFFICIALS IN SAIGON NOW ESTIMATETHAT HARD-CORE COMMUNIST STRENGTH HAS GONE UP FROM 23,000 TO 31,000OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS . BUT GOVERNMENT STRIKES ARE AT LEAST MORE ANDMORE FREQUENT . IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER, 55 SEPARATE OFFENSIVEGROUND ACTIONS OF BATTALION STRENGTH OR LARGER WERE UNDER WAY, CLOSE TOAN ALLTIME RECORD . CONVERSELY, RED ATTACKS ALSO INCREASED FROM 300 TO400 IN THE SAME PERIOD . AS THIS WEEK'S OPERATIONS ILLUSTRATE, HOWEVER,MANY GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE LEARNED TO STAND AND FIGHT .PERSONALITIES AND SAID SIMPLY : " WHAT HELPS THE WAR WE SUPPORT; WHAT INTERFERES WITH THE WAR EFFORT WE OPPOSE . WE ARE NOT THERE TOSEE A WAR LOST . THAT IS OUR POLICY . " AS IF TO QUIET U.S .NERVOUSNESS, DIEM AT WEEK'S END ANNOUNCED THAT MARTIAL LAW, WHICH HASBEEN IN EFFECT FOR ALMOST A MONTH, WILL END THIS WEEK, FORESHADOWING APOSSIBLE RETURN TO NORMALCY IN SOUTH VIET NAM .DRAGON LADY, DRAGONFLY IN A BLAZE OF FLASHBULBS, MME . NGO DINHNHU LEFT SAIGON LAST WEEK ON A TRIP TO BEIRUT, BELGRADE, AND POINTSWEST . ELABORATELY COIFFED AND GOWNED, SHE MET REPORTERS AND DEFENDEDHER VIEWS, ATTACKED HER ENEMIES, DODGED OVERLY CURVED QUESTIONS, ANDDISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLY FASCINATING FEMININE CHARM . WHETHER TWIRLING APARASOL OR HIDING SHYLY BEHIND AN IVORY FAN, SHE BOTH ATTRACTED ANDANNOYED . " I HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO SLAP HER, " SAID ONE FRENCHTELEVISION INTERVIEWER, " BUT FROM VERY, VERY CLOSE . " AFTER THELYNCHING . MME . NHU'S PERFORMANCE BEGAN AT THE SAIGON AIRPORT . SHESAID THAT WHEN HER MOTHER CABLED HER FROM THE U.S . URGING HER TO FLEESOUTH VIET NAM WITH HER CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR LIVES WERE IN DANGER,SHE HAD ANSWERED : " DEAR MOTHER, I AM SORRY YOU HAVE BECOMEINTOXICATED . " TO A QUESTION ABOUT HER ITINERARY, SHE SAID : "EVERYONE CALLS ME " THE DRAGON LADY.' FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, I WILL BELIKE THE DRAGONFLY OF THE VIETNAMESE SONG . WHEN IT'S HAPPY, IT STAYS; WHEN IT'S UNHAPPY, IT FLIES AWAY . " TENTATIVELY, MME . NHU SAID,SHE PLANNED TO VISIT THE U.S., THOUGH IT WOULD BE LIKE GETTING INSIDE "A LION'S CAGE . " / I SHALL JUST TALK EXTEMPORANEOUSLY, " SHE SAID . "I AM INVITED BY THE MOST IMPORTANT PRESS GROUPS . AFTER LYNCHING ME,MORE OR LESS, NOW THEY WISH TO HEAR ME . " SHE DENIED THAT SHE WASGOING TO BE SOUTH VIET NAM'S OBSERVER AT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERALASSEMBLY . " I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE U.N., " SHE SAID . " I AMNOT EVEN GOING THERE TO VISIT, BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT . "OFFICIAL CONSTERNATION . AT THE INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION CONFERENCE INBELGRADE, WHERE SHE REPRESENTED SOUTH VIET NAM, MME . NHU STOLE THESHOW WITH HER GRACEFUL PINK AODAI . THERE WAS FIRE IN HER EYES AND INHER WORDS . THE DIEM GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER YIELD TO " PERFIDIOUSBLACKMAILING ATTACKS, " SHE EXCLAIMED . WHAT ABOUT THE CONCERN FORSOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHISTS VOICED BY THE VATICAN ? POPE PAUL VI ISTOO " EASILY WORRIED, " RETORTED MME . NHU . HER ACID REMARKSUPPLEMENTED EARLIER COMMENTS ON THE SAME SUBJECT ON FRENCH TELEVISION: " AS A CATHOLIC, I AM ONLY REQUIRED TO BELIEVE IN THE DOGMAS OF MYRELIGION AND THE POPE . THE POPE IS ONLY INFALLIBLE WHEN HE DECREESSOMETHING EX CATHEDRA . I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WILL PUT HIMSELF INHIS CHAIR TO DISAVOW ME, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD BLOW TOCATHOLICISM . " REPORTS THAT SHE WOULD NOT STAY AT THE CONFERENCE UNTILITS CONCLUSION LEFT OFFICIALS NEAR CONSTERNATION . " IF MME . NHULEAVES ONE DAY EARLY, D ONE, " THEN THE CONFERENCE WILL HAVE LOST ITSIMPORTANCE . " BUT SHE SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF ENJOYING HERSELF . LETTINGFLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER REPORTS THAT JOHN F . KENNEDY MIGHT BE ABIT UNHAPPY WITH SOUTH VIET NAM'S WHOLE RULING FAMILY, MME . NHUSUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS " MISINFORMED ABOUT THE SITUATION INSOUTH VIET NAM . " / HE'S A POLITICIAN, AND WHEN HE HEARS LOUDOPPOSITION, HE TRIES TO APPEASE IT . " TWO DAYS LATER SHE HAD LUNCHWITH ANOTHER DELEGATE AT THE CONFERENCE . IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN THEPRESIDENT'S BROTHER, SENATOR EDWARD M . KENNEDY . LIKE OTHERS ON THEU.S . DELEGATION, TEDDY KENNEDY HAD HALFWAY HOPED TO AVOID THECONFRONTATION . BUT THEY HAD A CHAT . A LONG CHAT . " SHE DISCUSSED ATLENGTH HER SIDE OF THE PICTURE, " SAID TEDDY LATER . " SHE WANTED TOTALK TO ME . SHE WANTS TO TALK TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE . " IN FACT,DECLARED AN AWED WITNESS TO THE ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION, " SHE DID NOTSTOP TALKING FROM ONE MINUTE TO THE OTHER . " UNABLE TO GET A WORD INEDGEWAYS, TEDDY TOOK NOTES .IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS TART REMARK THAT PARTLY PROMPTED U.N .SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT TO MAKE SOME WHOLLY GRATUITOUS OBSERVATIONSAT A MANHATTAN PRESS CONFERENCE . CONDITIONS IN SAIGON WERE " CHAOTIC,/ DECLARED U THANT, ADDING THAT " CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES " ARE " AFEATURE WHICH IS COMPLETELY ABSENT IN VIET NAM . " THEY ARE, OF COURSE,COMPLETELY ABSENT IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, BURMA, WHICH IS RULED BY GENERALNE WIN, AS FIRM A DICTATOR AS EXISTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BUT NEVERCRITICIZED BY U THANT .
