EUROPE THE WAYWARD BUSS IN COMMUNIST EASTEUROPE, COMMISSARS AND COPS DO IT . IN ROME AND MADRID, MOPPETS INDANCING CLASS DO IT . FRENCHMEN PERFORM THE RITUAL WITH SINUOUS GRACE,SPANIARDS SMACKINGLY, GERMANS WITH A CLICK OF THE HEELS . HOWEVERWIDELY THEIR TECHNIQUES MAY VARY, EUROPEANS FROM BARCELONA TO BIALYSTOKIN RECENT YEARS HAVE TAKEN TO HAND KISSING WITH FERVOR AND FREQUENCYUNMATCHED IN THEIR HISTORY . AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE CUSTOM SEEMED INDECLINE . BUT TODAY, MEN OF VIRTUALLY EVERY CLASS AND CALLING ON THECONTINENT DIVE FOR DISTAFF KNUCKLES AS ASSIDUOUSLY, IF NOT ALWAYS SOEXPERTLY, AS DO THE COURTIERS IN A LEHAR OPERETTA . TELEGRAPHEDADMIRATION . TRADITIONALISTS DEPLORE THE TREND AND COMPLAIN THAT IT HASVULGARIZED A STYLISH, PATRICIAN RITUAL . IN THE OLD DAYS, NO WELL-BREDEUROPEAN KISSED A WOMAN'S HAND BEFORE NOON, OR OUTDOORS (EXCEPT ATGARDEN PARTIES OR THE RACE TRACK), OR IF SHE WORE GLOVES AND NOT ATALL, IN MOST COUNTRIES, IF SHE WAS UNMARRIED . NOWADAYS, EVEN INSTRAIT-LACED SPAIN, GIRLS WHO ARE BARELY OLD ENOUGH TO HOLD UP ASTRAPLESS BRA HAVE THEIR HANDS OUT . WHEN IT IS ENCLOSED IN A GLOVE,UNINHIBITED MALES BLITHELY PEEL IT OFF OR SMOOCH THE WRIST INSTEAD .AND NOW THAT THE HAND KISS HAS BECOME DEMOCRATIC, IT IS BESTOWEDALFRESCO, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE, EVEN WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS ON HORSEBACKOR IN CHURCH . NOTWITHSTANDING THE CELEBRATED ADVICE OF LORELEI LEE ( "A KISS ON THE HAND MAY BE QUITE CONTINENTAL, BUT DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'SBEST FRIEND " ), MOST EUROPEAN WOMEN WELCOME THE NEW WAVE OF HANDKISSING, AND TO THEIR MEN IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED A MORE INTRIGUINGAPPROACH TO A WOMAN THAN THE ASEPTIC ANGLO-SAXON HANDSHAKE . AS AVIENNESE SATIRIST WROTE IN 1825 : TO TAKE YOUR HAND FORA KISS IS MERELY TO ASK THIS : WILL THE MOUTH OF THE MISS PERMITFURTHER BLISS ?

IN EASTERN EUROPE AFTER WORLD WAR II, THECOMMUNISTS DENOUNCED THE PRACTICE AS A " CAPITALIST HANGOVER, " BUTTHEY SOON DESPAIRED OF CURING IT .
