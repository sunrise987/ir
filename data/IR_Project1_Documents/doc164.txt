SOUTH KOREA SILENT SAM, THE PRESSURE MAN THE WHITE HOUSE PUT THESQUEEZE ON THE BLUE HOUSE LAST WEEK, AND SOUTH KOREA'S MONTH-LONGPOLITICAL CRISIS VANISHED FOR THE MOMENT . BOWING TO WASHINGTON'SWISHES, GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, WHO OCCUPIES SEOUL'S BLUE-ROOFEDPRESIDENTIAL MANSION, AGREED TO LET CIVILIAN POLITICIANS HAVE THEIR SAYAT LEAST UNTIL NEXT AUTUMN . THE VICTORY BELONGED IN LARGE PART TO THEMAN WHO RELAYED THE U.S . PRESSURE, SHORT, WIRY, U.S . AMBASSADORSEMUEL D . BERGER . CALLED " SILENT SAM " BY THE KOREAN PRESS FOR HISRELUCTANCE TO MAKE PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS, CAREERIST BERGER, 51, IS ADISCREET, BEHIND-THE-SCENES DIPLOMAT . WHEN GENERAL PARKLAST MONTH IMPOSED A NEW BAN ON CIVILIAN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ANDANNOUNCED A REFERENDUM DESIGNED TO KEEP HIS MILITARY JUNTA IN POWER FORANOTHER FOUR YEARS, BERGER SET ABOUT THE TASK OF CONVINCING THE GENERALTHAT HE MUST ABIDE BY HIS PLEDGE TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY 17 MONTHS AGO TORESTORE CIVILIAN RULE IN 1963 . BERGER'S LEVER WAS THE U.S.'S ANNUAL$500 MILLION AID PROGRAM TO SOUTH KOREA, WITHOUT WHICH PARK'SGOVERNMENT COULD NOT REMAIN SOLVENT . TO A STEADY STREAM OF TOP KOREANOFFICIALS WHO CAME TO THE FOURSTORY U.S . EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN SEOUL,BERGER EXPLAINED THAT THE U.S . MIGHT HAVE TO RE-EXAMINE ITS AIDPROGRAM UNLESS PARK LET THE CIVILIANS COME BACK . TO SHOW THAT BERGERWAS NOT BLUFFING, THE U.S . RECENTLY DELAYED A PROMISED $25 MILLIONDESPERATELY NEEDED BY SOUTH KOREA TO PAY FOR IMPORT PURCHASES . WHENPARK FINALLY CAVED IN LAST WEEK, AGREEING TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER TODECIDE WHETHER TO CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS OR A VOTE ON HIS REFERENDUM,CIVILIAN POLITICIANS WERE AT FIRST INCLINED TO GRUMBLE AT PARK'SCOMPROMISE . BUT IN FACT, THEY NEEDED THAT MUCH TIME TO ORGANIZE THEIRPARTIES FOR AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN . THE CIVILIANS KNEW WHO THEIR MOSTPOTENT OPPONENT WOULD BE : GENERAL PARK HIMSELF, WHO NO DOUBT WOULDUSE THE SIX-MONTH POSTPONEMENT TO BUILD UP A GRASS-ROOTS POLITICALORGANIZATION STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP HIM SWITCH FROM FATIGUES TO FLANNELSAND TAKE OFFICE AS A CIVILIAN PRESIDENT .
