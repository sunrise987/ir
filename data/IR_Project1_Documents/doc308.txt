SOUTH VIET NAM THE BUDDHIST CRISIS IN SAIGON'S HUGE XALOI PAGODA, BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS WERE HOLDING A 48-HOUR HUNGERSTRIKE AGAINST THE REGIME OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM .EXPECTING TROUBLE, POLICE SEALED OFF NEARBY STREETS WITH BARBED WIRE .TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THE RITUALISTIC SUICIDE LAST MONTH, WHEN APROTESTING BUDDHIST MONK BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH ON A SAIGON STREETCORNER, TWO FIRE TRUCKS WERE ON HAND . SUDDENLY, ABOUT 500SAFFRON-ROBED BUDDHIST PRIESTS, LAYMEN AND WOMEN EMERGED FROM A NEARBYALLEY AND STARTED TO RUN TOWARD THE PAGODA TO JOIN THEIR FASTINGFELLOW-BUDDHISTS . STYMIED BY WIRE AND POLICE, THE DEMONSTRATORS SATDOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET . RIOT SQUADS ARRIVED . ARMED WITH AWALKIE-TALKIE RADIO, TWO SPORT-SHIRTED AMERICAN C.I.A . MEN DELIVERED ARUNNING COMMENTARY ON EVENTS TO HEADQUARTERS . A MONK WITH A PORTABLELOUDSPEAKER REPEATED : " WE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED MANY TIMES AND WE NOLONGER HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE REGIME . " GOVERNMENT SECRET POLICE INCIVILIAN CLOTHES YELLED BACK THAT THE BUDDHISTS WERE BEING EXPLOITED BYTHE COMMUNISTS . THEN THE POLICE CHARGED THE PEACEFUL SEATED CROWDS,CAUSING ONE OF THE UGLIEST SCENES IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S THREE-MONTHS-OLDBUDDHIST CRISIS . AT GUNPOINT . WITH RIFLE BUTTS, CLUBS AND TOMMY-GUNCLIPS, THE COPS BATTERED THE DEMONSTRATORS . WOMEN WHO HAD FALLEN TOTHE PAVEMENT IN THE FIRST POLICE RUSH WERE SAVAGELY KICKED . A YOUNGGIRL HAD HER HEAD SPLIT OPEN WITH A CARBINE BUTT, AND AS BLOOD STREAMEDINTO HER EYES, SHE WAS CARTED AWAY IN A POLICE VAN . FROM THE WINDOWSOF A BROTHEL, GIRLS SHOUTED INSULTS AT THE POLICE UNTIL FORCED INSIDEAT MACHINE-GUN POINT . THROUGHOUT SOUTH VIET NAM, GOVERNMENT FORCESCRUSHED BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS WITH SIMILAR VIOLENCE, ARRESTED NEARLY300 MARCHERS IN SAIGON ALONE, FOLLOWING ORDERS TO " USE ANY MEANS " TODISPERSE BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS . TOP U.S . EMBASSY PEOPLE IN SAIGONWERE " SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED " BY THE DIEM GOVERNMENT'S ACTION . ONEMONK DELIVERED A PROTEST NOTE TO THE EMBASSY, URGING THE U.S . TO FORCEDIEM TO RELENT ; U.S . AMBASSADOR FREDERICK E . NOLTING TELEPHONEDVIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AND GOT ASSURANCES THAT THE MAN WOULD NOT BEMOLESTED . BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MONK LEFT THAN SECRET POLICE AGENTSTRIED TO SPIRIT HIM AWAY IN A WAITING TAXI . THE PRIEST FOUGHT THEM OFFAND RACED BACK TOWARD THE U.S . EMBASSY . A U.S . OFFICIAL DRAGGED HIMTO SAFETY THROUGH THE DOOR AS A HUSKY MARINE GUARD PEELED A VIETNAMESECOP FROM THE PRIEST'S BACK . MORALITY CRUSADE . IRONICALLY, THE CRISISINVOLVES ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DOCILE RELIGIONS . YET, IN A SENSE,THAT VERY QUALITY MAKES BUDDHISM A PROBLEM . SINCE IT KNOWS NO SENSE OFSIN, AND HENCE NO REPRISAL FOR ERROR, IT IS, AT LEAST BY WESTERNSTANDARDS, PASSIVE, BACKWARD AND NEUTRAL . BUDDHISM, SAYS THEOLOGIANPAUL TILLICH, " GIVES NO DECISIVE MOTIVES FOR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION,AND THUS PROVIDES A NONPOLITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR AN INVASION OFBUDDHIST EAST ASIA BY THE COMMUNIST QUASI-RELIGION WITH ITS HOPE FOR ATRANSFORMED WORLD . " ALTHOUGH THE RED CHINESE ARE WOOING THE BUDDHISTSEVERYWHERE, THERE IS NO REAL EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THE REDS ARE USINGSOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHISTS, AS THE DIEM GOVERNMENT CHARGES . ON THEOTHER HAND, DIEM HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN USING THEM EITHER UNLIKETHAILAND'S STRONGMAN SARIT THANARAT, WHO HAS SHOWN THAT,WHEN HANDLEDPROPERLY, THEY CAN BE A SOLID, ANTI-COMMUNIST FORCE .UNTIL RECENTLY, THE BUDDHISTSIN SOUTH VIET NAM HAD NO REAL CASE AGAINST DIEM . SINCE THE BUDDHISTSWERE SOUTH VIET NAM'S DOMINANT GROUP FOR CENTURIES AND RESENT ROMANCATHOLICISM AS THE RELIGION OF THEIR FORMER FRENCH MASTERS DIEM HASTAKEN PAINS NOT TO SHOW OBVIOUS FAVORITISM TOWARD FELLOW CATHOLICS .ONLY THREE OF 19 ARMY GENERALS AND FIVE OF 17 CABINET MINISTERS ARECATHOLICS . THOUGH NEARLY HALF OF THE 123-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ISCATHOLIC, THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE CATHOLIC SCHOOLS TURN OUT BETTEREDUCATED GRADUATES THAN BUDDHIST SCHOOLS . MOST VIETNAMESE NEVERTHELESSBELIEVE THAT DIEM'S CATHOLIC RULING FAMILY HAS SHOWN BIAS . PRIMARILYMIDDLE-CLASS LANDOWNERS, VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS ARE ECONOMICALLY FAR MOREADVANCED THAN THE BUDDHISTS . THOUSANDS OF BUDDHISTS HAVE BECOMECONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM IN THE HOPE THAT THIS WOULD HELP THEMPROFESSIONALLY OR ECONOMICALLY . BUDDHISTS CLAIM THAT THE GOVERNMENTGIVES CATHOLICS BETTER LAND FOR SCHOOLS AND CHURCH BUILDINGS ANDDISCRIMINATES AGAINST BUDDHIST STUDENTS IN GRANTING STATE SCHOLARSHIPS. UNLIKE OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS, BUDDHISTS MUST HAVE SPECIAL GOVERNMENTPERMITS TO HOLD LARGE MEETINGS . " THIS PUTS US IN THE SAME CATEGORY ASTHE TRADE UNIONS, " SAYS ONE BUDDHIST PRIEST . WITH THEIR FREE AND EASYMORES, BUDDHISTS ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MORALITY CRUSADE OF MME . NGODINH NHU, WIFE OF DIEM'S BROTHER AND CLOSEST ADVISER . MME . NHU HASBANNED POLYGAMY, CONCUBINAGE, DANCING, AND EVEN FIGHTING FISH . HARDLINE . ALL THESE DISCONTENTS NEED NOT HAVE ERUPTED IF GOVERNMENT TROOPSHAD NOT STUPIDLY AND BRUTALLY GUNNED DOWN NINE BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATORSAT A RALLY IN HUE TWO MONTHS AGO . EVEN THEN, THE BUDDHIST CONTROVERSYWOULD PROBABLY HAVE DIED DOWN IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD OFFERED A PUBLICAPOLOGY, WHICH IS THE BUDDHISTS' CHIEF DEMAND, ALONG WITH SUCHPRACTICAL MATTERS AS FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, THE RIGHT TO FLY THEIR FLAG,BUDDHIST CHAPLAINS IN THE ARMY . BUT BROTHER NGO DINH NHU HAS ALWAYSURGED A HARD LINE . WHAT HE FEARS WITH SOME REASON IS THAT IF DIEMGIVES IN EVEN SLIGHTLY TO THE BUDDHISTS, IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE NEWDEMANDS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY THREATEN THE GOVERNMENT'S WHOLE POWERSTRUCTURE . BY WEEK'S END, HOWEVER, IN A BELATED ATTEMPT TO EASETENSIONS, THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED THE RELEASE OF 267 BUDDHISTS ARRESTEDDURING THE DEMONSTRATIONS . THOUGH HEAD PRIEST THICH TINH KHIET SAIDTHAT HE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN DIEM'S " HIGH VIRTUE, " NO TOP BUDDHISTHAS YET OPENLY ASKED FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE DIEM GOVERNMENT . BUT ANEW TYPE OF BUDDHIST LEADER IS EMERGING YOUNG, WELL-EDUCATED, TOUGH,AND IMPATIENT WITH THE OLDER MEN'S RELATIVE RESTRAINT . AS PASSIONSMOUNT AND THE POLICE CRACK DOWN HARDER, BUDDHISTS ARE BEING PUSHED INTOA DANGEROUS ATTITUDE OF MARTYRDOM . " WE DON'T WANT A POLICE STATE, "SAYS A BUDDHIST PRIEST . " WE DO NOT WANT TERROR OR DISCRIMINATION ORSTATE CONTROL . WE ARE LOYAL VIETNAMESE, BUT THE GOVERNMENT TREATS USLIKE COMMUNISTS . WE ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE OURSELVES AND TO DIE TOBRING FREEDOM TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH VIET NAM . " . . . (TRI-DOT)THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON THEBUDDHIST CRISIS . STEPPING UP THEIR ATTACKS, THE RED GUERRILLAS WOUNDED14 U.S . ADVISERS IN A MORTAR BARRAGE ON A U.S . COMPOUND IN CAN THOAND KILLED THREE AMERICANS WHEN THE REDS SHOT UP A U.S . MEDICAL CONVOYNORTH OF SAIGON .
