MIDDLE EAST UNION NOW THE ARAB WORLD LAST WEEK REELED INA DELIRIUM OF JOY . DAMASCUS RADIO REPEATEDLY SHRIEKED, " AHLAN BILWAHDA ! " (WELCOME TO UNION) . WHEN SYRIAN SOLDIERS SENT BURSTS OFTRACER BULLETS STREAKING AGAINST THE NIGHT SKY, THE RADIO ANNOUNCERHASTILY TOLD HIS EXCITED LISTENERS THAT IT WAS NOT REVOLUTION BUTJUBILATION . THE DREAM HAS COME TRUE ! HEADLINED A BEIRUT PAPER .ALEPPO NEARLY EXPLODED : ITS MAIN STREETS BECAME A SEA OF SCREAMINGHUMANITY, AND CARS INCHED ALONG HONKING THEIR HORNS TO THE RHYTHM, "NAS-SER ! " ALGERIA'S PREMIER AHMED BEN BELLA CABLED THAT THIS WAS "THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY OF MY LIFE ! " AND YEMEN'S STRONGMAN, ABDULLAHSALLAL, HAILED THE " OUTSTANDING HISTORIC EVENT . " CHEERING CROWDSMILLED THROUGH ADEN AND KUWAIT AND BAGHDAD . FESTERING WOUND . WHATTHRILLED THE ARAB WORLD WAS THE CAIRO ANNOUNCEMENT THAT EGYPT, SYRIAAND IRAQ HAD AT LAST AGREED TO UNITE IN A TRIPARTITE FEDERATION . THETERMS OF UNION WERE FAR STRONGER AND MORE CENTRALIZED THAN ARABS, ORANYONE ELSE, HAD EXPECTED . THERE HAD BEEN MUCH TALK OF A LOOSEASSOCIATION OF NATIONS MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS TOWARD ACTUAL UNITY. BUT THE PULSING ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOMENT APPARENTLY SWEPT ASIDE MUCHOF THE EARLIER RESTRAINT . A FEW DOZEN MEN IN CAIRO WERE GROPING FORTHE POLITICAL BLUEPRINT FOR A NATION STRONGER, RICHER AND MORE POWERFULTHAN ANY ARAB STATE FOR CENTURIES PAST . IF IT ALL WORKS OUT, THEPROPOSED NEW MIDDLE EASTERN POWER COMPLEX WILL COVER 620,300 SQ . MI.,STRETCH FROM THE BORDERS OF TURKEY AND IRAN TO SUDAN AND LIBYA, FROMTHE PERSIAN GULF TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND FAR DOWN THE RED SEA COAST .IT WOULD HAVE A POPULATION OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE (EXPECTED TO REACH 80MILLION BY 1985, GREATER THAN THE LARGEST NATION OF WESTERN EUROPE) ANDA TOTAL GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT OF $5.7 BILLION . HERO OF THE HOUR WASEGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . BETTER THAN ANY MAN, HE KNEWTHAT, ON THE HISTORICAL RECORD, THE ODDS WERE AGAINST SUCCESS . TIMEAND AGAIN, THE CHERISHED DREAM OF ARAB ONENESS HAS BEEN SHATTERED ONTHE IRRATIONALITY OF ARAB BEHAVIOR, ON PERSONAL RIVALRIES, AMBITIONS,CLASS DIFFERENCES AND COMPLICATED LEVANTINE INTRIGUES . AMID SHOUTS OFARAB JOY, EGYPT AND SYRIA FORGED THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC IN 1958, ONLYTO SEE IT COLLAPSE IN A WELTER OF BICKERING THREE YEARS LATER . DURINGTHE PAST FIVE WEEKS OF NEGOTIATIONS IN CAIRO, RUMORS SPREAD OFWRANGLING AND DISSENSION BETWEEN NASSER ON ONE SIDE AND THE SYRIAN ANDIRAQI LEADERS OF THE SOCIALIST BAATH PARTY ON THE OTHER . BOTH PICKEDAT THE " FESTERING WOUND " CAUSED BY BAATH'S BREAKUP OF THE EARLIER,ILL-STARRED UNION OF EGYPT AND SYRIA IN THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . EACHPUT THE BLAME FOR FAILURE ON THE OTHER . FINALLY, AT A PLENARY SESSIONIN THE GILTAND-CREAM GREAT HALL OF KUBBAH PALACE, NASSER PROPOSED ASHARING OF GUILT . " THE PRESENCE OF BAATH IN THE ARAB HOMELAND IS ANECESSITY, " HE DECLARED . " THE RESIGNATION OF THE BAATH MINISTERSFROM THE U.A.R . GOVERNMENT IN 1961 WAS A MISTAKE . ACCEPTING THERESIGNATIONS WAS ALSO A MISTAKE . " THE BAATHIST DELEGATES CLAPPED ANDCHEERED THIS BURYING OF THE HATCHET . IN A STARTLINGLY UN-ARAB SPIRITOF AMITY AND COMPROMISE, BOTH SIDES ACCEPTED THE OTHER'S GOOD FAITH ANDMINIMUM TERMS .CHEERFUL BORROWING . THE POINTS OF AGREEMENT ANNOUNCEDBY EGYPT'S PREMIER ALI SABRY INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATE RETAINING THE NAMEOF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, WITH CAIRO AS ITS CAPITAL . ALL CITIZENSWOULD SHARE ONE NATIONALITY, BUT EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS WOULD BESELF-GOVERNING AND IN CONTROL OF ITS SEPARATE ECONOMY . THE OVERALLGOVERNMENT BASED IN CAIRO WOULD HAVE A SINGLE PRESIDENT (ALMOSTCERTAINLY NASSER), A PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL WITH MEMBERS FROM EACH REGIONAND A BICAMERAL LEGISLATURE : A HOUSE WITH ONE MEMBER FOR EACH 60,000CITIZENS, AND A SENATE REPRESENTING THE REGIONS EQUALLY WITHOUT REGARDTO POPULATION . THE ARAB PRESS CHEERFULLY ADMITTED THAT MUCH WASBORROWED FROM THE U.S . CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT PROVIDED THE " IDEALFORM OF UNION AS PROVEN BY EXPERIENCE . " STICKING POINT IS NASSER'SINSISTENCE ON A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY FOR THE WHOLEU.A.R., MODELED ON HIS OWN ARAB SOCIALIST UNION IN EGYPT . SINCE THISWOULD SWALLOW UP AND PROBABLY DESTROY THE BAATH MOVEMENT, BAATHISTSHAVE HELD OUT FOR A LOOSER, MORE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM, INCLUDING THEBAATH-CREATED NATIONAL FRONT IN IRAQ, AND THE BAATHIST-NASSERITEUNIONIST FRONT IN SYRIA . IN THE END, NASSER WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HISWAY ON THIS, AS ON OTHER LIMITATIONS TO POLITICAL DEMOCRACY . A CAIROSPOKESMAN EXPLAINED, IN A PHRASE DEFINITELY NOT BORROWED FROM U.S .DEMOCRACY, THAT " FREEDOM WILL BE GUARANTEED TO THE PEOPLE, BUT NOT TOTHE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE . " THERE ARE MANY LESSER MATTERS STILL TO BEDECIDED . COMMITTEES WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO WORK OUT DETAILS OF CURRENCY,CUSTOMS, POSTAGE, DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER POLICIES . FOREIGN AFFAIRS WOULDBE UNDER THE NEW U.A.R . GOVERNMENT, AND EMBASSIES ABROAD WOULD BEMERGED . THE U.A.R., HOWEVER, MAY TRY TO HANG ON TO ITS THREE UNITEDNATIONS SEATS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT THE SOVIET UNION CONTROLS THEVOTES OF THE UKRAINE AND BYELORUSSIA . FREED SLAVES . MANY OBSERVERSSUSPECT THAT THIS NEW SHIP OF STATE MAY GO SWIFTLY ON THE ROCKS, BUTFEW OF THEM ARE IN THE ARAB WORLD . TWELVE MEMBERS OF OIL-RICH KUWAIT'S50-MAN LEGISLATURE FORMALLY REQUESTED UNITY WITH THE U.A.R . EVENNASSER'S TRADITIONAL ENEMIES, THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDIARABIA, MADE EFFORTS AT RECONCILIATION . JORDAN'S KING HUSSEINDISCREETLY LET 56 NASSERITE AND BAATHIST POLITICAL PRISONERS OUT OFJAIL AND SENT OFF FRIENDLY FEELERS TO NASSER . IN SAUDI ARABIA, ALARMEDBY A PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATION THAT COST 19 LIVES, PREMIER PRINCE FEISALTRIED TO MODERNIZE HIS REGIME BY ALLOTTING $1,200,000 AS COMPENSATIONTO SLAVE OWNERSWHO WOULD FREE THEIR CHATTELS . AT WEEK'S END CAIRORADIO WAS SPREADING WORD OF A CEASE-FIRE BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT INREBELLION-TORN YEMEN . IT SAID THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS PREPARED TO STOPSUPPLYING THE ROYALISTS SUPPORTING EX-IMAM BADR WITH MONEY ANDMUNITIONS, WHILE NASSER MAY WITHDRAW A TOKEN CONTINGENT OF HIS28,000-MAN EGYPTIAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BY APRIL 20 . THOUGH NASSER'SBROADCASTERS ARE NOT THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCES IN THE WORLD, THINGS MAYWELL COME TO THIS, FOR WITHOUT DOUBT JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AND ALLOTHER ARABS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANGERING NASSER
