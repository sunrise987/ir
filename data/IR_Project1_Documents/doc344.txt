MIDDLE EAST THE MESS IN YEMEN THE NASTY LITTLE WAR INYEMEN, ONE YEAR OLD THIS MONTH, IS DRAGGING ON IN GRAND DISREGARD FORTHE PEACE-SEEKING EFFORTS OF THE U.N . NEITHER EGYPT NOR SAUDI ARABIAHAS HONORED ITS PLEDGE, WHICH BOTH MADE EARLIER THIS YEAR UNDER U.S .MEDIATION PRESSURE, TO DISENGAGE SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM YEMEN . ALTHOUGHNASSER HAS SENT HOME SIX SHIPLOADS OF TROOPS, HE HAS ROTATED IN FRESHDETACHMENTS, AND AT LEAST 20,000 EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS ARE STILL IN YEMENPROPPING UP THE REPUBLICAN REGIME OF PRESIDENT ABDULLAH SALLAL . ALLTHE WHILE, MONEY AND MUNITIONS FROM THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA ANDJORDAN STILL POUR ACROSS THE 25-MILE-WIDE BUFFER ZONE TO ROYALISTTRIBESMEN SUPPORTING DETHRONED IMAM MOHAMED EL BADR . SO FAR AS THEACTUAL FIGHTING IS CONCERNED, IT IS STILL A STANDOFF, WITH THEREPUBLICANS CONTROLLING THE CITIES AND THE PLAINS, AND THE ROYALISTSHOLED UP IN AND DEFENDING KEY STRONG POINTS IN THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS .SHORT RATIONS . IT IS ALL VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE 200-MAN U.N . TEAM,WHICH WAS RUSHED TO THE SCENE FROM THE GAZA STRIP TWO MONTHS AGO IN ANEFFORT TO STOP THE SHOOTING . THE UNIT, MADE UP MOSTLY OF YUGOSLAVSOLDIERS AND CANADIAN AIRMEN, WAS FAR TOO SMALL TO POLICE THE VAST,EMPTY YEMEN FRONTIER, AND FROM THE START IT WAS PLAGUED BY BAD BREAKSAND HOSTILITY FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES . THE TEAM'S FIRST COMMANDER,SWEDISH MAJOR GENERAL CARL VON HORN, HAD HARDLY SET UP HEADQUARTERS INTHE MUDWALLED CAPITAL OF SAN " A WHEN HIS HORSE, BEING LED DOWN A DUSTYSTREET, KICKED A YEMENI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, RESULTING IN THE ARREST OFBOTH GROOM AND HORSE . U.N . PLANES ARE REGULARLY FIRED ON (NONE HASBEEN DOWNED SO FAR), AND LAST MONTH A RUSSIAN-MADE EGYPTIAN ILYUSHINJET BOMBER ATTACKING NAJRAN INSIDE SAUDI ARABIA NEARLY SCORED ADIRECT HIT ON A U.N . PLATOON . GETTING INTO THE ACT, THE RUSSIANS HAVESENT IN AT LEAST 900 WORKMEN AND TECHNICIANS, WHO ARE CONSTRUCTING ANEW JET AIRPORT NORTH OF SAN " A . RECENTLY, THE RUSSIANS THREW ANINQUIRING U.N . INSPECTOR OFF THE PREMISES WHEN HE APPROACHED THEAIRPORT TO CONDUCT A ROUTINE INSPECTION . APART FROM SUCH HARASSMENT,THE U.N . TEAMS FOUND IT DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS TO TRAVEL AROUND THECOUNTRY . ALL IN ALL, ADMITTED U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT, INEFFECT, THE U.N.SANCTIONED PROJECT HAS BEEN A FLOP . AND FOR HIM IT HASBEEN A RATHER MESSY FLOP, FOR IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS HE AND VON HORNHAVE HAD AN UGLY EXCHANGE OF RECRIMINATIONS . THE PRESTIGIOUS BUTSTORMY VON HORN, FIRST U.N . CHIEF IN THE CONGO AND FOR FIVE YEARS HEADOF THE U.N.'S PALESTINE PEACE-KEEPING FORCE, SUDDENLY RESIGNED IN ACABLE TO THANT, CHARGING LACK OF SUFFICIENT LOGISTIC SUPPORT, AIRCRAFTAND EVEN RATIONS . THANT BRANDED VON HORN'S CHARGES " IRRESPONSIBLE ANDRECKLESS, " ANNOUNCED LAST WEEKTHAT THE MISSION WOULD CONTINUE, THANKS TO " ORALASSURANCES " BY EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUESPLITTING THE BILL ($200,000 PER MONTH) FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS . SICKREBEL . ONE VICTIM OF THE YEMEN CONFLICT IS THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALLBY OVERTHROWING THE IMAM : EX-PALACE GUARD, NOW PRESIDENT AND FIELDMARSHAL, ABDULLAH SALLAL, 42 . LAST MONTH SALLAL FLEW TO CAIRO FORTALKS WITH NASSER, BUT ENTERED A HOSPITAL AND WAS DISCHARGED FORCONVALESCENCE ONLY LAST WEEK . A PHYSICIAN WHO HELPED TREAT SALLALCONFIDED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN . " PRESIDENTNASSER VISITED HIM ONCE BRIEFLY . WE GAVE HIM TRANQUILIZERS . WEBROUGHT IN EGYPT'S GREATEST COMEDIAN, ISMAYEN YESSIN, TO RAISE HISSPIRITS . WE SHOWED HIM MOVIES . WE FLEW IN HIS WIFE FROM YEMEN, " THEDOCTOR RELATED, BUT ADDED SADLY : " HIS SICKNESS IS REALLY POLITICAL .IF WE COULD GIVE HIM GOOD NEWS ABOUT YEMEN, HE WOULD RECOVER . "
