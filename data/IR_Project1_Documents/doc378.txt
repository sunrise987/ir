COLD WAR HOW MUCH TRADE WITH THE REDS ? NO ONE KNOWS BETTERTHAN MOSCOW THAT TRADE IS A WEAPON IN THE COLD WAR . " WITH EVERYADDITIONAL SHOVEL OF COAL, WITH EVERY ADDITIONAL LOAD OF OIL OBTAINEDTHROUGH FOREIGN HELP, " OLD BOLSHEVIK LEV KAMENEV ONCE PREDICTED, "CAPITALISM WILL BE DIGGING ITS OWN GRAVE . " FACED WITH THE CONTINUINGFAILURE OF THEIR ECONOMY, THE RUSSIANS MAY BE FORCED TO RELY ON WHEATFROM THE WEST FOR YEARS TO COME, BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WANT TO GET HOLD OFHEAVY INDUSTRIAL ITEMS INCLUDING WHOLE FACTORIES, WHICH RUSSIANINDUSTRY ON ITS OWN CANNOT DUPLICATE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME . WESTERNPOLICY IS DIVIDED ON HOW TO MEET THIS SOVIET COMMERCIAL APPEAL . SOMEBELIEVE THAT TRADE WITH THE RED BLOC MAY HAVE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE BYMAKING THE SATELLITES LESS DEPENDENT ON MOSCOW AND POSSIBLY MAKINGMOSCOW MORE DEPENDENT ON THE WEST . OTHERS, NOTABLY WEST GERMANY'SFORMER CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, FEEL THAT THE WEST SHOULD TRADE WITHRUSSIA ONLY IN RETURN FOR COLD WAR CONCESSIONS . WASHINGTON BELIEVESTHAT THIS POLICY IS NOT FEASIBLE, IF ONLY BECAUSE U.S . ALLIES AREEAGER TO TRADE WITH THE REDS, ARE SCARCELY EVEN WILLING TO RULE OUTSTRATEGIC ITEMS THAT NATO SPECIFICALLY FORBIDS . WESTERN EUROPEANEXPORTS TO THE SOVIET BLOC LAST YEAR CLIMBED BY 10 PER CENT TO $2.2BILLION(COMPARED WITH U.S . SALES OF $125 MILLION) . WHAT WASHINGTONWORRIES ABOUT IS NOT THE SHEER VOLUME OF SUCH DEALS BUT THE TERMS .WEAKENED WILLINGNESS . THE U.S . FEELS THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WANT TOTRADE, THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO USE UP THEIR MEAGER GOLD RESERVES ANDNOT BE GRANTED WHAT THEY WANT LONG-TERM CREDITS . SUCH CREDITS WOULDRELEASE MASSIVE SOVIET INVESTMENT FOR MILITARY NEEDS AND DIVERTFREE-WORLD RESOURCES FROM AID TO UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS . UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE BALL LAST WEEK WOUND UP A TOUR OF WESTERNEUROPE DURING WHICH HE ARGUED THE U.S . CASE FOR A UNIFIED, STIFFERWESTERN CREDIT POLICY AT LEAST 20 PER CENT CASH AND THE REST WITHINFIVE YEARS . BALL RECEIVED HIS FRIENDLIEST HEARING IN WEST GERMANY,EVEN THOUGH BONN TOPS THE LIST OF ALLIED TRADERS WITH THE REDS . WESTGERMANY LAST YEAR DID JUST OVER 1 BILLION WORTH OF OFFICIAL BUSINESSWITH MOSCOW AND ITS SATELLITES (INCLUDING $422 MILLION WITH THE SOVIETUNION AND $213 MILLION WITH EAST GERMANY) ; NO ONE CAN GUESSACCURATELY HOW MUCH MORE PRIVATE TRADE WENT ON . THOUGH SOME GERMANINDUSTRIALISTS WERE ANXIOUS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GUARANTEE LONG-TERMCREDITS, CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD RULED OUT THE IDEA AS LONG AS THESOVIETS BLOCK GERMAN REUNIFICATION . SAID ERHARD : " SUCH CREDITSWOULD STRENGTHEN THE SOVIET POSITION, SO THAT ITS WILLINGNESS TONEGOTIATE WOULD BE WEAKENED . " GENTLEMEN'S DISAGREEMENT . IN PARIS,BALL ALSO GOT A SYMPATHETIC RECEPTION, A PLEASANT CHANGE FOR A U.S .ENVOY THESE DAYS . FRANCE LAST YEAR EXPORTED TO THE SOVIET BLOC GOODSWORTH ONLY ABOUT $266 MILLION ; RUSSIAN BARTER PROPOSALS, INVOLVING ASWAP OF SOVIET COAL AND OIL FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARE HIGHLYUNATTRACTIVE SINCE FRANCE CAN SELL ITS OWN COAL AND OIL INSIDE THECOMMON MARKET . BESIDES, CHARLES DE GAULLE BELIEVES THAT TRADING WITHTHE SOVIETS IS A DIRTY BUSINESS (ALTHOUGH HE SEEMS WILLING TO TRADEWITH RED CHINA) AND RECENTLY DENIED AN EXPORT LICENSE TO A LEADINGFRENCH STEEL COMPANY THAT WAS ALL SET TO BUILD A REFINERY IN RUSSIA .ONLY IN LONDON DID BALL FIND OPPOSITION ; THE BRITISH FLATLY DECLINEDTO JOIN THE GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT TO RESTRICT THE SOVIETS' CREDIT .BRITAIN IS ESPECIALLY FOND OF THE IDEA THAT MORE TRADE WITH MOSCOW,INCLUDING STRATEGIC GOODS, WILL EVENTUALLY PACIFY THE SOVIETS .MOREOVER, THE NEW TORY GOVERNMENT IS EAGER TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT BYINCREASING OUTPUT AND SHIPPING THE GOODS OVERSEAS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE .THE PLAN HAS NOT WORKED SO FAR : BRITISH EXPORTS TO RUSSIA AND EASTERNEUROPE TOTALED ONLY ABOUT $310 MILLION IN 1962, AND NO BIG TRADE DEALAPPEARS IMMINENT .
