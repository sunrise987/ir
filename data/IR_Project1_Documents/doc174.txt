FRANCE ENCORE, NON IN A 20-MINUTE TV SPEECH LAST WEEK, CHARLESDE GAULLE MADE HIS FIRST PUBLIC ADDRESS SINCE THE HISTORIC JAN . PRESSCONFERENCE AT WHICH HE BARRED BRITAIN FROM EUROPE . AS THE BAROQUEPARAGRAPHS UNFOLDED, IT BECAME PLAIN THAT FRANCE'S PRESIDENT HAD NOTRETREATED FROM THE POLICIES THAT HAVE DIVIDED THE WESTERN ALLIANCE ANDHALTED THE INTEGRATION OF EUROPE IN THE THREE MONTHS SINCE . HIS VIEWSON KEY ISSUES . . .EUROPE . POLITICAL INTEGRATION OF EUROPE WOULD "INEVITABLY END IN FOREIGN DOMINATION " OF THE CONTINENT . IT WOULD, INANY CASE, BE " INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE FRENCHREPUBLIC " TO SURRENDER SOVEREIGNTY TO A SUPRANATIONAL PARLIAMENT,WHICH DE GAULLE DISDAINFULLY LIKED TO AN " AREOPAGUS, " THE SUPREMECOURT OF ANCIENT ATHENS . " IN SHORT, IT SEEMS TO US ESSENTIAL THATEUROPE SHOULD BE EUROPE AND FRANCE, FRANCE . " . ENGLAND . WITH ALL DUERESPECT TO " THE GREAT ENGLISH PEOPLE, " DE GAULLE FIRMLY INSISTED THAT/ UNION " OF EUROPE, MEANING APPARENTLY THE GAULLIST PROPOSAL FORCLOSER TIES BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, CANNOT WAIT FOR BRITAIN . " ONE DAY,PERHAPS, " ENGLAND WILL BE ADMITTED TO EUROPE AFTER IT HAS " DETACHEDITSELF " FROM ITS TIES WITH THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE U.S . .THE WESTERNALLIANCE . THE ALLIANCE IS " INDISPENSABLE SO LONG AS THE THREATS ANDAMBITIONS OF THE SOVIETS CONTINUE . " WHILE " CONJUGATING " ITS DEFENSEWITH NATO, HOWEVER, FRANCE " INTENDS TO REMAIN ITS OWN MASTER . ".NUCLEAR INDEPENDENCE . FRANCE'S FORCE DE FRAPPE IS ESSENTIAL TO "DISSUADE " WOULDBE AGGRESSORS AND " CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEFENSE OF ITSALLIES, INCLUDING WHO KNOWS ? AMERICA . " FOR THOUGH THE AMERICANS "ARE OUR GOOD ALLIES, AS WE ARE THEIRS, " IN THE EVENT OF NUCLEAR WARTHERE IS " IMMENSE AND INEVITABLE UNCERTAINTY " WHETHER RUSSIA AND THEU.S . WOULD USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ALL, OR ONLY IN EUROPE, OR WHETHERTHE TWO " CHAMPIONS " MIGHT NOT " HURL DEATH RECIPROCALLY INTO EACHOTHERS' VITALS . " CRITICS WHO SAY FRANCE'S DETERRENT IS USELESS OR TOOEXPENSIVE ARE IN " THE SAME CATEGORY OF LAGGARDS AND SCATTERBRAINS WHOCRIED, " NO HEAVY ARTILLERY' UNTIL 1914, " AND BEFORE 1939 " CRIED, "NO ARMORED CORPS ! NO FIGHTER AIRCRAFT ! " ' AS JOURNALISTS LIKE TOSAY, THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH THAT WAS " NEW " IN THE SPEECH . BUT THEREWEREN'T ANY NEW OBSTACLES EITHER .
