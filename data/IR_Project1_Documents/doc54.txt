LASTWEEK, HAVING STOOD FRANCE'S FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ON THEIR EARS, DEGAULLE TRIUMPHANTLY SURVEYED THE SCENE FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOME 120NEWLY ELECTED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTIES IN A RECEPTION AT ELYSEEPALACE . DE GAULLE, WHOSE ATTITUDE TOWARD ECONOMICS IS VAGUE AT BEST,LOFTILY EXPLAINED TO THE DEPUTIES WHY THE U.S . WANTED BRITAIN IN THECOMMON MARKET : " THE AMERICANS ARE GIVING AWAY THEIR PRODUCTS TO THESOUTH AMERICANS, THE AFRICANS, AND EVEN THE ARABS . THEREFORE THEY MUSTTRY TO SELL THEM IN EUROPE, WHICH CAN PAY FOR THEM . " THIS WAS WILDLYINACCURATE : U.S . SALES TO JAPAN AND CANADA ALONE IN 1962 TOTALEDALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS ITS $3.6 BILLION IN EXPORTS TO THE COMMONMARKET . WITH BRITAIN'S EXCLUSION, SAID LE GRAND CHARLES, THE U.S . ISNOW " MAKING USE OF ENGLAND " TO CREATE " A VAST NEW TRADE THINGAMAJIGWITH THE IRISH, THE ICELANDERS, AND SO FORTH . " THEN DE GAULLE TURNEDHIS REMARKS TO THE WEST GERMANS, FOR WHOM HE HAD SOME ADVICE ON HOW TOGOVERN THEMSELVES . " WHAT IS NEEDED IN GERMANY, " HE DECLARED, " IS ACONSTITUTION THAT WOULD PERMIT IT TO FACE MODERN CONDITIONS . "(GERMANY'S CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED AND ADOPTED IN 1949.) CHANGE OFTONE . DE GAULLE'S MOST DERISIVE COMMENTS WERE AIMED AT HAROLDMACMILLAN AND HIS COUNTRYMEN, WHO " ALWAYS MANAGE TO SEEM SORESPECTABLE . " DESCRIBING THE PRIME MINISTER'S TALKS WITH HIM ATRAMBOUILLET LAST DECEMBER, HE RELATED : " MR . MACMILLAN CAME TO TELLME WE WERE RIGHT IN MAKING OUR FORCE DE FRAPPE . " WE HAVE OUR OWN,TOO,' HE TOLD ME . " WE SHOULD TRY TO ASSOCIATE THEM IN A EUROPEANFRAMEWORK INDEPENDENT OF AMERICA.' ON THIS, HE LEFT ME FOR THE BAHAMAS. " THERE, ACCORDING TO DE GAULLE, MACMILLAN BETRAYED HIM BY AGREEINGINSTEAD TO ACCEPT POLARIS FORCE FROM THE U.S . AND THEN TO COMMIT IT,ALONG WITH BRITAIN'S OWN NEW NUCLEAR BOMBERS, TO A MULTINATIONAL NATONUCLEAR FORCE . SHRUGGING THAT THIS " NATURALLY CHANGED THE TONE " OFTHE JAN . 14 PRESS CONFERENCE AT WHICH DE GAULLE GUTTED BRITAIN'S HOPESOF JOINING EUROPE, DE GAULLE ADDED TESTILY : " MR . MACMILLAN, WHOM ILIKE, HAS HAD THE BRITISH PRESS COMPARE ME TO HITLER AND EVEN TONAPOLEON . " IN LONDON, IRATE BRITISH OFFICIALS WERE OFFENDED AT THEIDEA THAT MACMILLAN COULD DICTATE FLEET STREET'S LINE, EVEN IF HEWANTED TO .

SNAPPED ONEOFFICIAL : " THE FRENCH HAVE NOW GIVEN SEVEN DIFFERENT REASONS WHY DEGAULLE TURNED DOWN BRITISH MEMBERSHIP . THE ONLY THING THEY HAVEN'TCLAIMED YET IS THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SCOTLAND BEAT FRANCE 11-6 AT RUGBY ./ THE REAL REASON WHY DE GAULLE VETOED BRITAIN, RETORTED FOREIGNSECRETARY LORD HOME, WAS THAT " TWO VISIONS OF EUROPE HAD COME INTOHEAD-ON COLLISION . ONE WAS OF EUROPE SO ORDERED THAT IT WOULD BE ATHIRD FORCE, PROTECTED, EXCLUSIVE, NARCISSUS-LIKE IN ITS SELF-GLORY .THE OTHER, A EUROPE OF EQUAL, POLITICALLY MATURE NATIONS IN COMPLETEPARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICA AND DOING THEIR DUTY BY THE WHOLE WORLDOUTSIDE .
