MIDDLE EAST THE CAMEL DRIVER (SEECOVER) AT 6 : 30 ONE MORNING EARLY THIS MONTH, A PHONE SHRILLED IN THESMALL OFFICE OFF THE BEDROOM OF EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER .ALREADY AWAKE, HE LIFTED THE RECEIVER TO HEAR EXCITING NEWS : AMILITARY COUP HAD JUST BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST THE ANTI-NASSER GOVERNMENTOF SYRIA . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN . IT WAS THE MINISTER OF CULTURE ANDNATIONAL GUIDANCE . HOW SHOULD RADIO CAIRO HANDLE THE SYRIAN CRISIS ?SUPPORT THE REBELS, SNAPPED NASSER . THEN EGYPT'S BOSS RAPPED OUT ASUCCESSION OF TELEPHONED COMMANDS . TO THE AIR FORCE : ALERT THEBOMBERS AND FIGHTERS IN CASE THE SYRIAN REBELS CALL FOR HELP . TO THENAVY (SIX DESTROYERS AND TEN SUBMARINES) : STEAM NORTHWARD AND AWAITORDERS . TO THE ARMY : PREPARE TO MOVE IN CASE THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BETHINKING OF INTERVENTION ; PLACE MISSILES ON LAUNCH PADS READY TO FIRE. THIS DONE, NASSER FINISHED DRESSING AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS . THE PHONERANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF,WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME INIRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA .NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS ITWAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BETHE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOWSUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WASBOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERENOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NOFURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCHMILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS,THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE,CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARSAND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS ANDPRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OFPOLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING,FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS ANDTRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS . IT WAS QUITECLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED INNEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDELNASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELSPLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POUREDINTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONGCONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARABUNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, ANDTHE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THEENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTEROF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARABSTATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE ANDARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN,WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSERREBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THEMONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUTHATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS ATTHE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KINGSAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LASTWEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDIARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTSMAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THESWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE ITCOULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISETO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHENAND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMSTO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROMEVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMIDSERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS,YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKEDSHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIANSUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN ANDOUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDIARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT. NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHORESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TOINSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARESYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD ISINFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARECAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS AFOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALLTHE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICEOF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF " VOICES " (VOICE OF THEARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICHBLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIANORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER .RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OFSOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMEDAT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING ANEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED ATDESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST INTHE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY,WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUTTO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BESTENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UMKALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLYSTIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILDTHE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS ANASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEMARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDYSPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS. FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OFSUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HEHAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCEFEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS ANDCONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTSSUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT ISNASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARABWORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THEMAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY .HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THEMIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENITRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY AREFIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS .WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEPDESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIRCONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BESTHOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGEOF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGIONHANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIRDESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLSOF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THEHEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WESTOVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS ANINCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT ORIMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS ANDPASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WARI, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS ANDFOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THATTHEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCEOF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES,MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, ANDFRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THECOLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARABNATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WASSECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS ANDBUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIRWINSTON CHURCHILL " INVENTED " THE STATE OF JORDAN " ON A SUNDAYAFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . " EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THEPARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS .HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THEARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT .HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THEMASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABSIGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THATONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROMCOLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTSAND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVEDTHAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLYON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLYORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'SACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY ASPOPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEWSKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ONTHE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THESTATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OFWHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICHWERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGEOF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINETEL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ONTHE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WEREERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE,CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ONTHE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLODUNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHTBRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIRGRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED,AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY ANDDILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROMCAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HISCAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THENIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITORSELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THECAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED,WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK .SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THEINDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMESTHE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THEJEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHINAT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OFTHE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THEFELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCEOR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSEREGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP INTHE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, " I COULDN'T CARE LESS. " TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SITUP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE,TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THEREGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLYACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGNSWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP,COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'SFOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLDWAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS ANINCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTEDITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA ISFOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILLINCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THEU.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OFSURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE(AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S .FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACTIS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OFPOWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTERTHAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARDTHE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARDTHE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHTUNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERENATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BEREDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 AYEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THEGOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARENOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGNENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS ANDDOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FARLESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITSEDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZENASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNEDBECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, " IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONEWOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . "THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION,WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERYVILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TOPASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES .NASSER'S REVOLUTIONHAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLYTOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS ANASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIABROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OFPEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERESHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HASLARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRSTLEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THENDEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND ISPERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA ANDOTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES,WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'SGOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION ANDHEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWOEVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARECRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS .IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATIONPRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BEBARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS .IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUTMERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDEBIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST(A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISHTHE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED INPREGNANCY .THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THETHINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACEDBY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITSBORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS .INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUTDISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OFGENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OFARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEWGOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENTYOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS ANDINTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED,MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIANWHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS ANDHOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THEBRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVERHIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL,CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, ANDCLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLEABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINETMINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDEDSHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS ADAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HEGRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLEWHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT ADAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICSAND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WASA MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HEOVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS " NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFOREEVERYTHING ELSE, " AND " A NEW PAGE IS OPEN, THE PAGE OF THOSE WHO WALKWITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . " HE DEFINESREVOLUTION AS " THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE,WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . " THEBAATH SLOGAN, " UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, " WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATEDBY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKEOVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, ANDFREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TOIRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THEPARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASSINTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVEGOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OFMILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS ADEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN .NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMEDTAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTOACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITYWAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ONTHE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THESAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATEDAS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODEDBY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIANECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVESTRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL .AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINETMINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRYSECESSION FROM THE U.A.R .IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THEMOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTEROF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'SCOMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILEDAND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS ANDPRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTEDINTHE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNISTALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSEROFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA. THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKINGABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONEWANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO ISANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUALRECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARABUNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TOACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, " PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON APROPER BASIS . " MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : " JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AREWELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES ANDRULERS . " IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HEINTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATEDUNION WITH SYRIA . " THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, " NASSERTOLD TIME LAST WEEK, " WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION ANDAMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES. " TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIANDELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITHNASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED,HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTIONOF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE .THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TOCAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZEDAUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITHHARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREEOF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDINGEVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . " SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATESWOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THATTHEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKSBETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHINGCONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST,TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONESO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT .THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . INDAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISONCELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS ASIDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . " WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITHNASSER THE WAY WE WANT, " HE SAID . " WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPTTHE WAY NASSER WANTS . " BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLEEAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINTMAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITYOF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONSIN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITIONSQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR ANADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES .ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HASGIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : "NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HISHEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OFEXTERNAL EXPANSION . " THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'SDREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UPONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THEINTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HERBORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO. MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WESTBANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN. BRITAIN'SPRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZINGNASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THEBRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY,BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EASTCOLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . " NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OILIS AMBIGUOUS, " COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . " OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TOCONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . " BRITISH AND U.S. OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'SINTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF6,500,000 BBL . " WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, "SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSEACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL.,BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THEPRODUCER'S PROFITS . " ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OILINDUSTRY, " EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . " IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITYAND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . " DRAWNLINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUSAT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HASTURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHENCAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOTINCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THEMAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS ATASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BESINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOODOF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HASAIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THEMONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUTTHERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . " IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLDTHREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LLHAVE TO TAKE A STAND, " SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S .CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARABWORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO APRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THEEISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LASTWEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENTTOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD .GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HISEARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCEEGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH " IMPERIALIST " GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEANDEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENTADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE " KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TOUNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDERJOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WEFACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS ./ HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, " IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S .STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFTA GOOD IMPRESSION . " PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVEBECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . " WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, "SAYS NASSER . " WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONESTAND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACHOTHER . " THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHOSPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HISBRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS .THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THEMIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S .DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : " IMUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . " JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END INCAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OFCIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THENEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BEWHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HEHAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HEAPPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OFJIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.SA DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HESTILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN INTHE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : "I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTEDHELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TOSAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOODTECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . " EVEN MORETHAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGINGFROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( " BETTERTHE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS " ) . THERE AREPROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER,OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, " THE CAMELDRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . " BUT PROVERBS AREECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THATWHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL,BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONSINVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TENYEARS .
