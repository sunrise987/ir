WEST GERMANY IT IS STILL THERE TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCEBERLIN WAS SEVERED BY THE WALL . ON ITS ANNIVERSARY LAST WEEK, MOSTWEST BERLINERS HEEDED OFFICIAL APPEALS TO REFRAIN FROM VIOLENT, FUTILEDEMONSTRATIONS . INSTEAD, THEY OBSERVED THE DAY QUIETLY BY PLACINGWREATHS ON THE DOZENS OF CROSSES MARKING EACH SPOT WHERE A FLEEING EASTGERMAN HAD BEEN SHOT TO DEATH BY COMMUNIST GUARDS . ONLY LATE IN THEEVENING WAS THE CITY'S GRAVE CALM BROKEN BY A MOB OF SOME 2,000HELL-RAISING WEST BERLINERS WHO SURGED INTO THE AREA AROUND CHECKPOINTCHARLIE, HURLING ROCKS AND INSULTS ACROSS THE WALL INTO THE SOVIETSECTOR . IF GERMANS HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THE BERLIN WALL AND THEDEADLY, 830MILE BARRICADE THAT DIVIDES THE REST OF THEIR NATION, ONNEITHER SIDE HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN OR FORGIVEN ITS EXISTENCE . THE MOSTELOQUENT EVIDENCE OF EAST GERMANS' REFUSAL TO ACCEPT SOVIETIZATION ISTHAT 16,456 OF THEM HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES AND FLED TO THE WEST SINCETHE WALL WENT UP . AMONG THEM WERE 1,304 MEMBERS OF EAST GERMANY'S ARMYAND POLICE FORCE, ENOUGH TO FORM 13 COMPANIES . AT LEAST 65 MORE EASTGERMANS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE .FACTS OF LIFE . DESPITE THIS SOMBER CHRONICLE OF FLIGHT AND DEATH, MANYPOLITICIANS AND PUNDITS OUTSIDE GERMANY STILL CLING TO THE NOTION BASEDIN PART ON DEEP-ROOTED FEAR OF RESURGENT GERMAN POWER THAT ITS PEOPLEARE GRADUALLY BECOMING RECONCILED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S PARTITION . INWEST GERMANY ITSELF, THIS VIEW IS ACCEPTED IN SOME QUARTERS, MOSTLYBECAUSE IT IS A FACT OF PRESENT EUROPEAN LIFE THAT THE RUSSIANS CANNOTBE MOVED OUT OF EAST GERMANY, EXCEPT BY WAR, A WEST GERMAN SURRENDER TOCOMMUNISM, OR SOME KIND OF SETTLEMENT FOR WHICH WEST GERMANY MIGHT HAVETO PAY A RUINOUS PRICE . AS A RESULT, MANY GERMANS ARE BEGINNING TOPONDER MEASURES THAT FALL SHORT OF ACTUAL REUNIFICATION SUCH AS TRADEPRESSURE DESIGNED TO PERSUADE WALTER ULBRICHT TO GIVE EAST GERMANS ALITTLE MORE FREEDOM AND A SOMEWHAT BETTER LIFE . FRANZ THEDIECK, STATESECRETARY FOR ALL-GERMAN AFFAIRS, SAID RECENTLY : " OF COURSE WE WOULDLIKE TO SEE GERMANY REUNITED, BUT IF THERE WERE CONDITIONS OF FREEDOMIN EAST GERMANY THE EXISTENCE OF ONE SINGLE GERMAN STATE WOULD NOT BEABSOLUTELY NECESSARY . " EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHER KARL JASPERS CREATED AFUROR BY SUGGESTING IN 1960 THAT HIS COUNTRYMEN MUST ACCEPT CHANGES INTHE MAP OF GERMANY AS PART OF THEIR LIABILITY FOR HITLER . MANY GERMANSNOW ACCEPT HIS THOUGHT : " THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS IS FREEDOM .COMPARED WITH THAT, REUNIFICATION IS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE THETHOUGHT IS LARGELY ACADEMIC, SINCE IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TOLIBERALIZE THE ULBRICHT REGIME AS TO GET THE RUSSIANS OUT OF EASTGERMANY . THE JASPERS LINE THUS MAY TEMPER BUT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THEBASIC URGE FOR REUNIFICATION IN A COUNTRY WHICH ACHIEVED NATIONAL UNITYLATER THAN OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS AND IS FIERCELY INSISTENT ON ITSETHNIC IDENTITY . HENCE BONN'S OPPOSITION TO ANY EAST-WEST AGREEMENTTHAT WOULD FORMALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY SEAL THE STATUS QUO . SAYS AWESTERN AMBASSADOR IN BONN : " THE ISSUE OF GERMAN UNITY STILL HASMORE EXPLOSIVE POTENTIAL THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE ON THE POLITICAL SCENE INGERMANY TODAY . WE'D BE FOOLS TO UNDERESTIMATE IT . " SHIFT TO RIGHT .FAR FROM SYMBOLICALLY AND PHYSICALLY SEALING GERMANY'S DIVISION, THEWALL HAS BECOME A CONSTANT, INESCAPABLE REMINDER TO WEST GERMANY'S 57MILLION CITIZENS THAT 17 MILLION OF THEIR COMPATRIOTS LIVE IN PRIVATIONAND TERROR . OLDER GERMANS, INCLUDING DISTINGUISHED SOCIOLOGIST HELMUTSCHELSKY, HAVE WARNED REPEATEDLY THAT A COMPLACENT YOUNGER GENERATIONWILL IN TIME COME TO REGARD THEIR COMPATRIOTS " OVER THERE " ASFOREIGNERS . HOWEVER, GERMAN STUDENTS ON THE WHOLE SEEM TO AGREE WITHCHRISTA ROLL, A 23-YEAR-OLD MUNICH STUDENT, WHO ARGUES THAT IDEALISTICYOUNGSTERS HAVE BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE WALL . SINCE IT WENT UP,SHE SAYS, " THE INTELLECTUAL CENTER OF GRAVITY HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT. BEFORE THAT, A LOT OF LIBERALS WOULD STILL PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOREAST GERMANY NOW AND THEN . BUT THE WALL CHANGED THEM, FOR IT WASEXACTLY THE KIND OF UGLY SUPPRESSION THAT EVERY PROGRESSIVE ISSUPPOSEDLY FIGHTING AGAINST . " MOST GERMANS EVEN THOSE WHO ACKNOWLEDGETHAT REUNIFICATION CANNOT BECOME REALITY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTUREAGREE THAT IT IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE . RECENT OPINION POLLS SHOW THAT 54PER CENT OF WEST GERMANY'S CITIZENS CONSIDER THEIR COUNTRY'S DIVISION "AN UNBEARABLE SITUATION . " ANOTHER SURVEY, TAKEN LAST YEAR, INDICATEDTHAT 40 PER CENT CONSIDER REUNIFICATION THE NATION'S MOST URGENTPROBLEM ; ONLY 17 PER CENT GAVE FIRST PRIORITY TO THE PRESERVATION OFPEACE . EVIDENCE OF THEIR CONTINUING CONCERN FOR THEIR KIN IS THE RISEIN WEST GERMANS' SHIPMENTS OF FOOD AND CLOTHING TO COMMUNIST GERMANY :FROM 35 MILLION IN 1950, THE NUMBER OF PACKAGES CROSSING THE BORDER HASRISEN TO MORE THAN 52 MILLION A YEAR . A WHOLE NEW LITERATURE IN WESTGERMANY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH THE ALIENATION OF EAST AND WEST, " THEDREADED DREADFUL STRANGENESS, " AS UWE JOHNSON WROTE IN SPECULATIONSABOUT JAKOB, IN WHICH FRIENDS AND RELATIVES DIVIDED BY THE BORDERGRADUALLY CEASE TO BE INDIVIDUALS IN EACH OTHER'S EYES, INSTEAD BECOMEPOLITICAL SYMBOLS . EMOTIONALLY, AT LEAST, A UNITED NATION REMAINS THEASPIRATION OF A VAST MAJORITY OF WEST GERMANS . THE U.S . WOULD ONLYPAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW AND DANGEROUS WAVE OF GERMAN NATIONALISM BYIGNORING IT .
