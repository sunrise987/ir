GREAT BRITAIN TROLLOPE, HOT TIDE BETTER EDUCATION . NEW INDUSTRIES. BETTER TRANSPORT . THAT PROMISE, IN FIVE COLUMNS OF TYPE ACROSSNEWSPAPER PAGES, WAS MADE LAST WEEK BY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY,LAUNCHING ITS FIRST ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN SINCE ITSYOU-NEVER-HAD-IT-SOGOOD SERIES IN 1959 . THE TORIES' NEW THEME : "BRITAIN IS MODERNIZING NOW AND ONLY THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE GOT WHAT ITTAKES TO SEE THE JOB THROUGH . " THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO SET ADATE FOR THE ELECTION, THE COSTLY MANIFESTO SUGGESTED THAT PRIMEMINISTER MACMILLAN INTENDS TO GO TO THE PEOPLE SOONER RATHER THAN LATERPERHAPS IN THE FALL . NEXT DAY THE OPPOSITION BURST INTO PRINT WITH ITSOWN LONG-PLANNED AD CAMPAIGN FEATURING A NEW SYMBOL, A WELL-KNUCKLEDTHUMBS UP THE TOILER'S EQUIVALENT OF THE TORY V-FOR-VICTORY GESTURE ANDTHE SLOGAN : LET'S GO WITH LABOR . THE LABORITES DEVOTED HALF OF THEIRFIRST BOLD SPREAD TO A PICTURE OF PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON FOR ONCEWITHOUT A PIPE AND USED THE REST OF THE SPACE TO EXPLAIN THE " CHANGESTHE NEW LABOR GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO MAKE . " THEY RANGED FROM ASHAKE-UP IN INDUSTRY ( " TOO MANY DIRECTORS SITTING IN BOARD ROOMSBECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND " ) TO AN EXPANDED SCIENTIFICPROGRAM TO " PREVENT OUR BEST BRAINS FROM TAKING JOBS ABROAD . " IFTHERE WAS NOTHING STARTLINGLY NEW IN LABOR'S PROMISES OR, FOR THATMATTER, IN THE TORIES' COPY MANY BRITONS WERE ASTONISHED THAT THESOCIALISTS HAD TAKEN ANY ADVERTISING AT ALL . AFTER THE 1959 ELECTIONCAMPAIGN, LABORITES THUNDERED THAT THE TORIES' AD AGENCY HAD USED "MADISON AVENUE METHODS " TO " SELL MACMILLAN LIKE A DETERGENT . " WHENHE PROJECTS HIS OWN IMAGE, HAROLD MACMILLAN SOUNDS MORE LIKE TROLLOPETHAN TIDE . IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PUBLISHER JOCELYN STEVENS IN LASTWEEK'S ISSUE OF QUEEN MAGAZINE, THE PRIME MINISTER INDULGED IN SOMEMELLOW RUMINATIONS THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CUED BY AN ADMAN : ONPOWER . I NEVER HAD ANY FEELING ABOUT BECOMING PRIME MINISTER . I TOOKTHINGS AS THEY CAME AND STILL DO . POWER IS LIKE A DEAD SEA FRUIT .WHEN YOU ACHIEVE IT, THERE'S NOTHING THERE . THE ART OF GOVERNMENT ISMIXING THE THINKERS AND DOERS . ON HIMSELF . YES I AM SENSITIVE TOCRITICISM . ONE HAS TO BE . THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I LOATHE EVERYBODY,AND THEN I RETIRE AND READ GIBBON FOR A FEW HOURS . . . I AM AHIGHLANDER . THAT'S WHY I'M SO PALE . IT'S TRUE I GET A BIT TIRED, BUTI SOON POP UP AGAIN . ON HIS WARDROBE . MY CLOTHES EDWARDIAN ? ITHOUGHT THAT CARDIGANS WERE RATHER SMART AT THE MOMENT . I ALWAYS WEARTHE SAME SUIT . WHEN IT WEARS OUT, I TELL MY TAILORS TO SEND ME ANOTHERAROUND . ON LIKES & DISLIKES . WHAT DO I DISLIKE ? QUESTIONS IN THEHOUSE OF COMMONS ; I CAN'T BEAR THEM . WHAT ELSE ? THINGS THAT HAVENO PURPOSE FORMALITIES LIKE THE FUNCTION I'M GOING TO THIS EVENING .WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO DO IS GO OFF WITH DOROTHY IN THE CAR, ALONE, TOSCOTLAND . WHERE THE HEDGES CEASE, THERE IS REAL FREEDOM . . . NO, IDON'T GET ENOUGH EXERCISE, THOUGH YESTERDAY I HAD A FOUR-HOUR WALKTHROUGH THE WOODS . I WENT TO SEE MY GAMEKEEPER :. HE WASN'T TOOHOPEFUL ABOUT NEXT SEASON'S PROSPECTS .
