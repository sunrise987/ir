NATO NAGGING IN MOMENTS OF GRAVE CRISIS, NATO IS A MODEL OFARM-IN-ARM HARMONY . BUT WHEN THERE ARE NO BERLIN BLOCKADES OR CUBANMISSILES TO BRING OUT THEIR UNDERLYING UNITY, THE WESTERN ALLIES AREDIVIDED . THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT ANYWHERE THAT THE U.S . HAS CRUSHINGNUCLEAR SUPERIORITY OVER THE RUSSIANS . DISAGREEMENT ARISES OVER THEQUESTIONS OF 1) HOW MUCH OF A VOICE EUROPE IS TO HAVE AS TO WHEN ANDHOW THIS U.S . FORCE IS TO BE APPLIED, AND 2) WHAT WESTERN STRATEGYSHOULD BE IN THE INTERMEDIATE GREY AREA SHORT OF TOTAL WAR, AN AREA INWHICH NATO IS PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT POLITICALLY THAN MILITARILY .THESE PROBLEMS SWIRLED UP AGAIN THIS WEEK AS THE FOREIGN AND DEFENSEMINISTERS OF 15 NATO NATIONS SAT DOWN FOR THEIR BIG ANNUAL REVIEWCONFERENCE IN PARIS . MASSIVE OR FLEXIBLE . FOR THE RECORD, THE AGENDAWAS CROWDED WITH DISTANT GENERAL MATTERS : WHAT NEXT IN DISARMAMENTTALKS WITH RUSSIA ? WHAT MEANING FOR THE WEST IN THE SINO-SOVIETSPLIT ? BUT IN A KIND OF CORRIDOR WARFARE AND IN SEPARATE BILATERALMEETINGS, SOME FACTIONS TRIED TO MANEUVER THE U.S . INTO GIVING EUROPEMORE SAY IN THE USE OF THE H-BOMB, AND OTHERS LOOKED FOR WAYS TOFRUSTRATE CHARLES DE GAULLE'S FORCE DE DISSUASION . UNDER U.S . URGING,SECRETARY-GENERAL DIRK STIKKER (AILING AND PROBABLY DUE FOR EARLYRETIREMENT) IS CARRYING OUT SWEEPING STUDIES TO REASSESS NATO FORCELEVELS AND BASIC STRATEGY . THE FRENCH HAVE BEEN WORKING AGAINST THE "STIKKER STUDIES . " CLINGING TO THEIR OWN MASSIVE RETALIATION THEORY,WHICH HOLDS THAT ANY AGGRESSION IN EUROPE MUST TURN INTO A NUCLEAR WAR,DE GAULLE'S MEN SNEER ATWASHINGTON'S CONCEPT OF " BALANCED " CONVENTIONAL-AND-NUCLEAR FORCES TOPROVIDE A " FLEXIBLE RESPONSE " TO RED MOVES . FORCE OR FARCE . PARISIS EQUALLY SKEPTICAL OF WASHINGTON'S PROPOSED MULTILATERAL FORCE ( "MULTILATERAL FARCE, " THE FRENCH CALL IT) . SO ARE MOST OF THE OTHERALLIES . BUT AT LEAST A FEW ARE BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT THE IDEASURFACE SHIPS ARMED WITH POLARIS WEAPONS AND MANNED BY MIXED CREWS FROMVARIOUS NATO NATIONS JUST MIGHT WORK. NO ONE HAS ANY OTHER PRACTICALOR EVEN IMPRACTICAL PLAN TO GIVE EUROPE A GREATER SHARE IN THE USE OFTHE BOMB . FROM THE RATIONAL FRENCH VIEWPOINT, THE SENSE OF " SHARING "PROVIDED BY MLF WOULD BE AN ILLUSION, SINCE THE U.S . WOULD STILLRETAIN CONTROL OF THE MISSILES THEMSELVES . BUT LYNDON JOHNSON HASHINTED THAT THIS CONTROL MIGHT BE TRANSFERRED TO THE EUROPEANS IF ANDWHEN EUROPE TRULY UNITES . THERE WERE OTHER NATO PROBLEMS AND SQUABBLES: THE COMMAND STRUCTURE IS BADLY OUTDATED, AND THE WESTERN BIG THREEARE TOO HEAVILY REPRESENTED ON NATO STAFFS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERALLIES . ONE CONCRETE ACCOMPLISHMENT : AGREEMENT TO SET UP A $308MILLION ELECTRONIC SYSTEM STRETCHING FROM NORWAY TO TURKEY THAT WILLPROVIDE QUICK IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL FOR SUCH FASTMOVING NEWAIRCRAFT AS THE F-104 . ITS LESS THAN MARTIAL NAME : NADGE (NATO AIRDEFENSE GROUND ENVIRONMENT) .SKEPTICS WERE REMINDED THAT NELSON'S FLAGSHIPVICTORY AT TRAFALGAR IN 1805 WAS MANNED BY 16 DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES .
