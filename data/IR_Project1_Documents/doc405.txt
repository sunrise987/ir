ESPIONAGE A BLONDE BOND HE PLANTED A LONG, PASSIONATE KISS ON MYLIPS AND PRESSED MY BACK AGAINST THE DOOR UNTIL I WAS LIMP . THEN HESWUNG ME EASILY OFF THE FLOOR AND STARTED TO CARRY ME UP THE STAIRS . "CHARLES, " I REMONSTRATED FEEBLY, " WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? " HE LOOKEDAT ME HUNGRILY . " JUST POINT OUT YOUR BEDROOM, " HE SAID . " YOU HAVENOTHING TO FEAR, CHERIE . " AS A LOVER, CHARLES BROUSSE WAS THE MOSTARDENT OF ALL THOSE I MET IN MY CAREER AS A SPY . . . DESPITE THEBOTTLED-IN-BOND FLAVOR, THE SCENE ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN WARTIMEWASHINGTON . IT WAS RECOUNTED RECENTLY IN LONDON'S THE PEOPLE BY ITSHEROINE, A MATA HARI FROM MINNESOTA WHO WORKED FOR BRITISH INTELLIGENCEUNDER THE CODE NAME CYNTHIA . HER REAL NAME : ELIZABETH PACK . USINGTHE BOUDOIR AS IAN FLEMING'S HERO USES A BERETTA, SHE WAS DESCRIBED BYHER WARTIME BOSS AS " THE GREATEST UNSUNG HEROINE OF THE WAR . " AFTERTHE WAR CYNTHIA MARRIED HER ONETIME PREY, THE ARDENT CHARLES, AND WITHHIM RETREATED TO A REMOTE 10TH CENTURY FRENCH CHATEAU WHERE SHE DIEDLAST WEEK, AT 53, OF THROAT CANCER . SCUPPERED ADMIRAL . WHEN WORLD WARII BROKE OUT, BLONDE, GREEN-EYED CYNTHIA HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR NINEYEARS TO ARTHUR PACK, A COLORLESS BRITISH DIPLOMAT WHO WAS NEARLY TWICEHER AGE . THE DAUGHTER OF A U.S . MARINE CORPS COLONEL, AT 29 SHE WASADVENTUROUS, ASTUTE, ATTRACTIVE AND, FROM DILIGENT YEARS ON EUROPE'SDIPLOMATIC CIRCUIT, ALREADY AN OLD HAND AT AFFAIRS OF STATE . LEAVINGHER HUSBAND, SHE RETURNED TO THE U.S . SHORTLY AFTER THE FALL OFFRANCE, IMMEDIATELY JOINED BRITISH SECURITY COORDINATION (B.S.C.), THEMANHATTANBASED INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERESPIONAGE NETWORK THAT WAS RUNBY SIR WILLIAM STEPHENSON, THE FAMED " QUIET CANADIAN . " HE SENTCYNTHIA TO WASHINGTON, WHERE SHE TOOK A GEORGETOWN HOUSE ON O STREETAND WENT TO WORK . CYNTHIA'S FIRST BIG ASSIGNMENT WAS ENOUGH TO DAUNTTHE WILIEST OLD PRO : HER ORDERS WERE TO GET HOLD OF THE ITALIAN NAVALCODE BOOK . WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF FIRST MEETING THE SHAPELY BETTY PACK,ITALY'S NAVAL ATTACHE, ADMIRAL ALBERTO LAIS, WAS SO SCUPPERED BY HERTHAT HE SURRENDERED THE CODE WITH HARDLY A MURMUR . ITALIAN APOLOGISTSMAINTAIN THAT LAIS, WHO DIED IN 1951, WAS ACTUALLY SO UNGALLANT AS TOGIVE HIS MISTRESS A FAKE CIPHER BOOK . UNDENIABLY, HOWEVER, BRITISHINTELLIGENCE THEREAFTER PROVED UNCANNILY ADEPT AT FORESTALLING ITALIANFLEET MOVEMENTS, NOTABLY IN THE MARCH 1941 SEA BATTLE OFF GREECE'S CAPEMATAPAN, WHERE THE ROYAL NAVY CRIPPLED ITALY'S NUMERICALLY SUPERIORFORCE . OUTWITTED WATCHMAN . FOR THE U.S . AS WELL AS BRITAIN,CYNTHIA'S MOST VALUABLE COUP WAS TO CAPTURE THE SECRET CODE USED BY THEVICHY GOVERNMENT'S DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH FLEET,WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS OF ALLIED LIVES DURING THEINVASION OF NORTH AFRICA . POSING AS A WASHINGTON NEWSHEN, CYNTHIA HADALREADY SEDUCED THE DASHING CAPTAIN BROUSSE, THEN THE PRESS ATTACHE INTHE PETAIN GOVERNMENT'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY ; BY PLAYING ON HIS HATREDOF THE NAZIS, SHE MADE HIM A WILLING ALLY . " I WAS NOT JUST INDULGINGHIS DESIRES SO AS TO GET HIM TO DISCLOSE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATICINTELLIGENCE, " WROTE CYNTHIA . " I WAS FULFILLING A DEEP NEED OF MYOWN . " BROUSSE MORE THAN SATISFIED HER BOSSES' NEEDS AS WELL BYSUPPLYING DAILY COPIES OF ALL FRENCH DIPLOMATIC CABLES . IN 1942, WHENTHE EMBASSY'S NAVAL ATTACHE PROVED SEDUCIBLE BUT OBDURATELY PRO-VICHY,BROUSSE EVEN AGREED TO HELP HER FILCH THE CODE BOOKS FROM THE ATTACHE'SOFFICE SO THAT THEY COULD BE COPIED AND RETURNED TO THE EMBASSY SAFEUNNOTICED . THEIR TACTICS WERE EXQUISITELY GALLIC . CHARLES SHOWED UPAT THE EMBASSY WITH CYNTHIA ONE NIGHT AND, RUSTLING A FEW DOLLAR BILLS,WHISPERED TO THE UNDERSTANDING WATCHMAN THAT MME . BROUSSE WASSUSPICIOUS OF THEIR LIAISON (SHE WAS, INDEED, AND LATER DIVORCED HIM) .THE EMBASSY, BROUSSE EXPLAINED TO THE GUARD, WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHEREHE AND HIS GIRL COULD RENDEZVOUS, AND THEY SOON BECAME REGULAR VISITORS. ON THE NIGHT THEY PLANNED TO LIFT THE CODE, WITH THE HELP OF ASAFEBREAKER CALLED THE GEORGIA CRACKER, THEY PUT THE WATCHMAN TO SLEEPWITH DRUGGED CHAMPAGNE, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE LOCKS WERE SO TOUGH THATTHEY HAD TO COMPLETE THE JOB A FEW NIGHTS LATER . BY NOW, THEY GUESSEDTHAT THE NIGHT WATCHMAN MUST SUSPECT THAT IT WAS NOT JUST AMOUR THEYWERE AFTER . SURE ENOUGH, SOON AFTER CYNTHIA AND HER LOVER ENTERED THEDARKENED OFFICE, THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND THE WATCHMAN STUDIED THEMUNDER A POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT . FINALLY, HE BLURTED, " I BEG YOUR PARDON,MADAME, A THOUSAND TIMES, " AND FLED DOWN THE CORRIDOR . BEFORE GOINGTO WORK ON THE SAFE, CYNTHIA HAD TAKEN THE SIMPLE PRECAUTION OFREMOVING ALL HER CLOTHES .
