ALGERIA A HEX ? THINGS BEGAN GOING WRONG ALMOST FROM THEMOMENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER SAILED INTO ALGIERS HARBOR TO BEGIN HIS STATEVISIT . THE DAY HE ARRIVED, AN ALGERIAN MINESWEEPER THAT HAD ESCORTEDNASSER'S YACHT SANK WITH THE LOSS OF THREE CREWMEN . THEN A PALL WASCAST OVER THE CELEBRATIONS BY THE DEATH OF ALGERIA'S FOREIGN MINISTERMOHAMMED KHEMISTI, WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY A CRAZED ASSASSIN (SEEMILESTONES) . ON TOP OF ALL THAT, A MOST UNUSUAL TORNADO SWEPT ACROSSTHE COUNTRY, KILLING TWELVE ALGERIANS IN ONE VILLAGE . MANY ASUPERSTITIOUS ALGERIAN PEASANT WAS CONVINCED THAT THE EGYPTIAN VISITORHAD BROUGHT A HEX WITH HIM . BUT THERE WAS A MORE CONCRETE REASON FORTHE DISAPPOINTMENT NASSER TOOK WITH HIM LAST WEEK WHEN HE PULLED UPANCHOR AND SAILED AWAY THREE DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED . FROM HOSTAHMED BEN BELLA, ALGERIA'S YOUNG PREMIER, NASSER HAD GOTTEN HEARTYCORDIALITY AND WORDS OF ACCLAIM, BUT NO REAL PROMISE TO BRING ALGERIAINTO NASSER'S SCHEME FOR A UNITED ARAB REPUBLICSCIPLE . AS THE ONLY TWOSOCIALIST RULERS IN THE ARAZ WORLD, THEY HAD MUCH IN COMMON . AND BENBELLA WAS DULY GRATEFUL TO NASSER FOR HIS AID IN THE LONG STRUGGLEAGAINST FRANCE . BUT AT THE CONFERENCE TABLE, NASSER FOUND BEN BELLA TOBE NO FAWNING DISCIPLE . COOL, TOUGH AND INDEPENDENT, THE ALGERIANSAPPEARED MORE INTERESTED IN THEIR OWN REVOLUTION THAN IN MORE GRANDIOSESCHEMES . TEN MONTHS AFTER INDEPENDENCE, ALGERIA'S 46-YEAR-OLD BACHELORPREMIER IS BUSY CONSOLIDATING PERSONALIZED CONTROL OVER HIS RESTIVELAND . LAST MONTH HE ELIMINATED HIS MOST DANGEROUS RIVAL, OLDREVOLUTIONARY COMRADE MOHAMMED KHIDER, BY FORCING HIM OUT ASSECRETARY-GENERAL OF ALGERIA'S RULING NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . BENBELLA TOOK OVER THE PARTY POST HIMSELF . ALSO, BEN BELLA IS IMPLANTINGHIS OWN BRAND OF " ARAB SOCIALISM . " HE HAS NATIONALIZED ONE-THIRD OFALGERIA'S FARM LAND, MOST OF IT FRENCH-OWNED, AND HANDED IT TO "MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES " OF TURBANED PEASANTS . HIS REGIME HAS SEIZEDSCORES OF CINEMAS, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS FROM ALGERIANS WHO, IN BENBELLA'S WORDS, " FATTENED THEMSELVES LIKE PASHAS " BY BUYING UPPROPERTY FROM FLEEING FRENCHMEN . UNSPOKEN ALLIANCE . BUT BEN BELLA'SBRAND OF SOCIALISM HAS DISTINCT LIMITS . ALGERIA'S CHIEF ALLIANCE IS ASTRANGE, UNSPOKEN ONE, NOT WITH THE COMMUNISTS OR WITH ANY ARAB LAND .IT IS WITH FRANCE, ALGERIA'S ONETIME OVERLORD . AS IF TO MAKE CLEAR ITSCONTINUED ENDORSEMENT OF BEN BELLA, FRANCE RECENTLY AGREED TO SPEED UPPAYMENT OF ITS SUBSIDIES TO ALGERIA, BUDGETED FOR $210 MILLION THISYEAR, WHICH COMPRISE BEN BELLA'S CHIEF ECONOMIC SUPPORT . IN RETURN,ALGERIA PROMISES TO USE ONE-FIFTH OF THE TOTAL TO COMPENSATEEXPROPRIATED FRENCH LANDLORDS .
