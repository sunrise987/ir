COLD WAR OF BASES & BOMBS AT FIRST GLIMPSE, IT CERTAINLYBORE ALL THE SIGNS OF A U.S.-SOVIET DEAL . FIRST THE NEWS BROKE THATPREMIER KHRUSHCHEV, IN A SECRET LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY, HAD AGREEDTO REMOVE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO A NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BYPERMITTING ON-SITE INSPECTIONS IN RUSSIA . SOON AFTERWARD, THE U.S .CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS PREPARING TO DISMANTLE ITS JUPITER BASE INTURKEY, THE VERY THING THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD DEMANDED WHEN THE U.S .FORCED HIM TO GET HIS MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES OUT OF CUBA, AND ITS BASESIN ITALY, TOO . WAS THERE REALLY A DEAL ? NO . THE TWO EVENTS HAVEREALLY NO CONNECTION . THE KHRUSHCHEV OFFER, WHILE PROOF OF HISCONTINUED MELLOWING, IS NEGLIGIBLE ; ANY TEST BAN WOULD DEPEND ONCONDITIONS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL NOW . AS FOR THE REMOVAL OFAMERICAN MISSILE INSTALLATIONS FROM TURKEY AND ITALY, ITS PURPOSE, SAIDPRESIDENT KENNEDY, IS SIMPLE TO PUT THE U.S . " IN A STRONGER POSITION/ BY SUBSTITUTING POTENT POLARIS SUBMARINES FOR THE IMMOBILE,VULNERABLE IRBMS, SITTING DUCKS FOR SOVIET RETALIATION . SOLID V .LIQUID . MONTHS BEFORE KHRUSHCHEV SUGGESTED HIS CUBA-FOR-TURKEY SWAP,THE JOINT CHIEFS HAD BEGUN CONSIDERING THE PHASE-OUT OF BASES INTURKEY, ITALY, AND IN ENGLAND AS WELL . THE DISMANTLING OF THE 60 THORMISSILES IN BRITAIN IS TO BEGIN THIS SPRING . MORE THAN COMPENSATINGFOR THEIR LOSS ARE EIGHT POLARIS SUBS OPERATING OUT OF HOLY LOCH,SCOTLAND, EACH TOTING 16 MISSILES . TO REPLACE THE 15 JUPITERS INTURKEY AND THE 30 IN ITALY, THE U.S . PLANS TO DEPLOY POSSIBLY SIX SUBSIN MEDITERRANEAN WATERS . TOTAL FIREPOWER : 96 MISSILES, EACH WITH ANUCLEAR-TIPPED WARHEAD PACKING THE EQUIVALENT OF 800,000 TONS OF TNT .COMPARED WITH JUPITER'S 1,500-MILE REACH, THE CURRENT POLARIS MISSILESHAVE A RANGE OF 1,380 TO 1,725 MILES, AND BEFORE LONG THE SUBS WILL GETA-3 MODELS WITH A 2,875MILE RANGE . THOUGH MOSCOW IS HARD AT WORK ONANTI-SUB DEVICES, U.S . EXPERTS SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVECOME UP WITH AN EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST THE FLEET OF 41 POLARIS SUBSTHAT WILL BE AT SEA BY 1967 . BOTH TURKEY AND ITALY SWIFTLY ACCEPTEDTHE CHANGEOVER . TO PROVIDE BERTHING FACILITIES FOR THE SUBS, THE U.S .HOPES TO EXPAND ITS NAVAL BASE AT ROTA ON SPAIN'S ATLANTIC COAST .QUESTION OF BOXES . THE CHANCE OF A WORKABLE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATYSEEMED EQUALLY REMOTE . ACTUALLY, KHRUSHCHEV FIRST AGREED TO THEPRINCIPLE OF ON-SITE INSPECTIONS WAY BACK IN 1959, WHEN BRITAIN'S PRIMEMINISTER MACMILLAN WAS IN MOSCOW, ONLY TO SHELVE IT AFTER HE BROKE THETHREE-YEAR TEST MORATORIUM IN 1961 . BUT HAVING CONCLUDED HIS OWNLATEST NUCLEAR TEST SERIES, KHRUSHCHEV DOUBTLESS FIGURES THAT HE HASLITTLE TO LOSE FROM AN EFFORT TO STOP ALL TESTING FOR A WHILE . " THETIME HAS COME NOW, " KHRUSHCHEV WROTE KENNEDY JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, "TO PUT AN END ONCE AND FOR ALL TO NUCLEAR TESTS . WE ARE READY TO MEETYOU HALFWAY . " TO NIKITA, HALFWAY MEANT TWO OR THREE INSPECTIONS EACHYEAR TO INVESTIGATE SUSPICIOUS TREMORS ; THE U.S . THOUGHT THAT EIGHTINSPECTIONS WOULD BE THE MINIMUM, HAVING WHITTLED THAT DOWN FROM ITSORIGINAL TWELVE . WHILE THE U.S . HAS BEEN DEMANDING THAT AT LEAST ADOZEN UNMANNED SEISMIC DETECTION STATIONS, OR " BLACK BOXES, " BEINSTALLED ON SOVIET SOIL, KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT THREE WOULD DO ONE EACHIN SIBERIA'S ALTAI MOUNTAINS, THE VIRGIN LANDS OF SOVIET CENTRAL ASIAAND THE SOVIET FAR EAST . " WE BELIEVE, " HE CONCLUDED, " THAT NOW THEROAD TO AGREEMENT IS STRAIGHT AND CLEAR . " ATMOSPHERIC NOISE . THISWAS CLEARLY NOT KENNEDY'S VIEW, BUT HE DECLARED HIMSELF " ENCOURAGED, "SUGGESTED THAT EXPLORATORY TALKS BE HELD AND, AFTER THEY GOT STARTED,ORDERED A HALT TO THE CURRENT SERIES OF U.S . UNDERGROUND TESTS TOIMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS . LAST WEEK SOVIET U.N . AMBASSADORNIKOLAI T . FEDORENKO AND VETERAN GENEVA NEGOTIATOR SEMYON K .TSARAPKIN WERE CLOSETED IN WASHINGTON WITH U.S . ARMS CONTROL ANDDISARMAMENT AGENCY CHIEF WILLIAM C . FOSTER AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR SIRDAVID ORMSBY GORE . THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF PROBLEMS . IN MOSCOW, DOURFOREIGN MINISTER ANDREI GROMYKO DECLARED, " FRANCE MUST SIGN, " FULLYAWARE THAT DE GAULLE HAS NO INTENTION OF JOINING A TEST BAN . ANOTHERQUESTION WAS HOW TO RING IN RED CHINA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO EXPLODE ANA-BOMB BY YEAR'S END . SINCE PEKING HAD NOT YET DONE SO, GROMYKO SAID,THE PROBLEM WAS " ARTIFICIAL . " ANXIOUS TO KEEP THE TALKS GOING, U.S .OFFICIALS GRASPED AT STRAWS  AND HOPEFUL PHRASES .  " I DON'T THINKTHIS CLOSES THE DOOR, " SAID ONE . " IT'S JUST ATMOSPHERIC NOISE . "
