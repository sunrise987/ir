THAILAND ALAS, POOR ELEPHAS ! HE'S LOSING CLASS WHENKING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ LAST WEEK CELEBRATED HIS 36TH BIRTHDAY APARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT ANNIVERSARY TO THAIS, WHO MEASURE LIFE INTWELVE-YEAR CYCLES TRADITIONALISTS WERE SADDENED NOT TO FIND A SINGLEROYAL ELEPHANT TAKING PART IN THE ELABORATE CEREMONIES . IN THAILAND,AS ELSEWHERE IN ASIA, THE ONCE ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE OF THE ELEPHANT HASDECLINED DRASTICALLY . WHILE ELEPHANT OWNERSHIP IS STILL CONSIDEREDPRESTIGIOUS, A NEW CADILLAC OR MERCEDES (THE KING OWNS SEVERAL OF EACH)NOW RATES FAR HIGHER AS A STATUS SYMBOL THAN A MATURE, 15-YEAR-OLDELEPHAS MAXIMUS WITH 40 YEARS OF RUGGED MILEAGE AHEAD OF HIM . NOPARKING . THAILAND NOW HAS FEWER THAN 10,000 REGISTERED WORKINGELEPHANTS V . SOME 150,000 AUTOMOBILES . SAYS ONE OLD-SCHOOL THAI : "OH, YES, RICH MEN STILL USE ELEPHANTS, BUT ONLY WHEN THEY GO INTO THEFOREST TO WORK . WHERE FRIENDS CAN SEE THEM, THEY RIDE AUTOMOBILESINSTEAD . " WHILE THE USED-ELEPHANT MARKET HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DEPRESSEDBY AUTOMATION, A MAHOUT-MAINTAINED MODEL WITH BUCKET SEAT, TWO-TONEUMBRELLA AND STICK SHIFT COSTS UP TO 1,500 F.O.B . BANGKOK, OR ABOUT$4,000 DELIVERED AT THE BRONX ZOO . IN THAILAND A U-RIDE-IT ELEPHANTIS STILL A BARGAIN AT $2.50 A DAY (ONE TENTH AS MUCH AS A RENTED TRUCK)AND IS STILL HARD TO BEAT WHEN IT COMES TO BIRD WATCHING, SPRAYINGTREETOPS OR HAULING LOGS . BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PACHYDERMPARKING SPACE IN BANGKOK . SHRUGS A TAXICAB MAHOUT : " ELEPHANT TOOMUCH FIGHTING, TOO MUCH KICKING, TOO MUCH EATING . I LIKE PLYMOUTH .PLYMOUTH ONLY TAKES GAS ONE TIME A DAY . " WHITE MODEL NOSTALGIC THAISRECALL THE GLORIOUS DAYS WHEN SIAM'S ELEPHANT CORPS WAS ITS DREADEDFORCE DE FRAPPE. AS A MEMBER OF SEATO, THAILAND NOWADAYS SETS MORESTORE BY ITS U.S . SUPPLY TANKS . NONETHELESS, ALLOWS COLONELDAMNERN LEKHAKUL, A MILITARY HISTORIAN ATTACHED TO THE THAI GENERALSTAFF, " IF A WAR COMES, WE MAY HAVE TO RELY ON ELEPHANTS FOR JUNGLECOMBAT OR IF WE RUN OUT OF GAS . " MOST THAIS ALSO STILL BELIEVE,WITH EDWARD TOPSELL, AN EARLY 17TH CENTURY BESTIARIST, THAT THEELEPHANT IS A " GREAT AND AMPLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER AND WISDOMOF ALMIGHTY GOD " PARTICULARLY THE WHITE VARIETY . KING BHUMIBOL HASDEMOCRATICALLY QUARTERED HIS OWN NINE-YEAR-OLD WHITE MODEL IN THEBANGKOK ZOO . THERE, WHEN HE REACHES MATURITY IN A FEW YEARS, THEHANDSOME SPECIMEN MAY BECOME THE FIRST WHITE ELEPHANT EVER TO BE MATEDIN CAPTIVITY . THEY INSIST TOTHIS DAY THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THEIR KING MONGKUT'STIMELY OFFER OF ELEPHANTS IN 1862 . REGRETFULLY, LINCOLN EXPLAINED TOTHE KING THAT THE U.S . CLIMATE DID NOT " FAVOR THE MULTIPLICATION OFTHE ELEPHANT . " IT IS POSSIBLE, NONETHELESS, THAT IF THE UNION HADBEEN ABLE TO FIELD A PACHYDERM PANZER DIVISION, THE U.S . CIVIL WARMIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESHORTENED .
