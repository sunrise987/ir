IRAQ GREEN ARMBANDS, RED BLOOD A WEEK AFTER THE OVERTHROWIRAQ'S DICTATOR ABDUL KARIM KASSEM, THE CRACK OF RIFLE FIRE STILLECHOED IN BAGHDAD'S LIBERATION SQUARE . TANKS AND ARMORED CARS KEPTSTERN VIGIL AT EVERY IMPORTANT INTERSECTION . SCURRYING EVERYWHERE WERETHE LITTLE SQUADS OF MEN WEARING GREEN ARMBANDS FERRETS WHO SOUGHT TOFIND AND TO CRUSH THE LAST REMAINING OPPOSITION TO REBEL PRESIDENTABDUL SALAM AREF AND HIS MYSTERIOUS REVOLUTIONARY BACKERS . WHO WERETHESE NEW RULERS ? IN THE MODERN MODE, AREF, 41, GRITTED HIS TEETHAND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE BAGHDAD HOTEL FOR THE INEVITABLE PRESSCONFERENCE WITH THE SWARM OF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, AN ORDEAL HESEEMED TO REGARD AS IN SOME WAYS WORSE THAN THE HISTORIC NIGHT OF THECOUP ITSELF . MORE THAN A HUNDRED SHOUTING REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERSPUSHED ASIDE HIS TOMMY-GUN-WAVING GUARD AND CROWDED AROUND IRAQ'S BOSSTO HEAR AREF SPEAK FREELY ABOUT THE AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE NEWGOVERNMENT . HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT AN END TO ONE-MAN RULE, FRIENDSHIPWITH ALL ARAB STATES, AND THE " OVERCOMING OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIESFACING THE IRAQI PEOPLE . " BUT HE WAS MYSTERIOUSLY SILENT ABOUT THESIZE OR MEMBERSHIP OF THE ALL-POWERFUL NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THEREVOLUTIONARY COMMAND, WHICH ORGANIZED AND LED THE REVOLT AGAINSTKASSEM . NO PERSONALITIES . SAID AREF : " THIS IS A SECRET WHICH MUSTREMAIN A SECRET FOR MANY REASONS . " ASKED WHY, ENGLISHSPEAKING AREFREPLIED VOLUBLY IN ARABIC . PRESSED AGAIN FOR AN ANSWER, AREF SUDDENLYANNOUNCED, " THE CONFERENCE IS CLOSED, " AND DEPARTED, SURROUNDED BYHIS GUARDS . THE REASON FOR SUCH SECRECY SEEMS TO BE A GENERALREVULSION AGAINST THE SELFGLORIFICATION OF KASSEM'S FOUR-YEARDICTATORSHIP . " WE REVOLTED AGAINST THE CULT OF PERSONALITY, "EXPLAINED NEW FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB HUSSEIN SHABIB, 32 . TO THE KEYQUESTION OF WHO IS BOSS OF THE NEW IRAQ, THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE : ATTHE MOMENT, NO ONE MAN . PRESIDENT AREF CANNOT MAKE MAJOR DECISIONSWITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS NATIONAL COUNCIL . BUT HIGHLYVISIBLE WAS THE NEW 21-MAN CABINET, AND MOST WESTERN OBSERVERS LIKEDWHAT THEY SAW . SAID ONE : " IN GENERAL, THEY'RE A TOPNOTCH BUNCH OFRESPONSIBLE, EAGER, EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE . " MANY OF THEMINISTERS HAVE LIVED OR HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN THE WEST, RANGING FROMFOREIGN MINISTER SHABIB, WHO GRADUATED FROM LONDON UNIVERSITY AND ISMARRIED TO AN ENGLISHWOMAN, TO FINANCE MINISTER SALIH KUBBA, WHOATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND HAS AN INTERNATIONALREPUTATION AS AN ECONOMIST . SEVEN OF THE NEW CABINET MINISTERS WERE INKASSEM'S CONCENTRATION CAMP AT RASHID MILITARY BASE UNTIL THE REBELSBROKE DOWN THE GATES DURING THE COUP . THE BAATH IDEA . THE NEWGOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY ANTI-COMMUNIST, AND ALL BUT FIVE MINISTERS AREEITHER MEMBERS OF OR CLOSELY LINKED TO THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY .MORE AN IDEA THAN AN IDEOLOGY, THE BASIC BAATH DOCTRINE INSISTS THAT "THERE ARE NO ARAB NATIONS ; THERE IS ONLY ONE ARAB NATION . " THISCREED IS, OF COURSE, WARMLY EMBRACED BY EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, BUTAREF AND IRAQ'S BAATH PARTY SEEM HARDLY EAGER TO FALL UNDER CAIRO'SDOMINATION . THE BAATHIST LEADERS IN IRAQ, IN FACT, HAVE RESHAPED THEIRDOCTRINE OF ARAB UNITY INTO A CONCEPT OF FEDERATION OF ARAB STATESWITHOUT A CENTRALIZED DICTATORSHIP . THIS COULD MEAN ANYTHING,INCLUDING A REVIVAL OF THE OLD CONCEPT OF LOOSE UNITY IN THE " FERTILECRESCENT " IRAQ, SYRIA, JORDAN AND LEBANON . ALREADY SYRIA, HAVINGBROKEN FREE FROM NASSER, WAS PROPOSING FEDERATION TO IRAQ'S NEW LEADERS. THE IDEAS OF THE NEW IRAQIS SEEM LIBERAL, HUMANE AND DEMOCRATIC . BUTSO DID KASSEM'S PROGRAM WHEN HE FIRST SEIZED POWER ; HIS REIGN SWIFTLYDRIFTED TO BRUTALITY AND DEGRADATION . NORMAL TORPOR . BY WEEK'S ENDIRAQ SEEMED SETTLING DOWN INTO THE NORMAL TORPOR OF AN ARAB STATE AFTERA COUP D'ETAT . OIL FLOWED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THROUGH THE PIPELINES TO THEMEDITERRANEAN . SHOPS, SCHOOLS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICES REOPENED . THECURFEW WAS GRADUALLY EXTENDED FROM 3 IN THE AFTERNOON UNTIL 11 ATNIGHT, AND IN THE COFFEEHOUSES MEN WERE GOSSIPING AND PLAYINGBACKGAMMON .THE LOCAL COMMUNISTS, THEONLY GROUP STILL SUPPORTING THE DISCREDITED KASSEM REGIME, WERE BEINGSTRIDENTLY URGED BY MOSCOW'S POWERFUL ARABIC VOICE IN EAST GERMANY TO "STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCIST IMPERIALIST REGIME NOW FOISTED ON IRAQ . "SOME COMMUNISTS RESPONDED BY SNIPING FROM ROOFTOPS, BUT THEIRORGANIZATION HAD SUFFERED A DEVASTATING BLOW . HUNDREDS OF THE DOGGEDMEN WITH GREEN ARMBANDS, CARRYING MIMEOGRAPHED LISTS OF RED LEADERSCOMPLETE WITH HOME ADDRESSES AND AUTO LICENSE NUMBERS, METHODICALLYHUNTED DOWN THE COMMUNISTS, WHO HAD GROWN STRONG IN KASSEM'S FINALMONTHS . BY LAST WEEK THE NEW REGIME HAD KILLED OR JAILED NEARLY 2,500DISSIDENT COMMUNISTS . THIS WAS ENOUGH TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF WESTERNDIPLOMATS . BUT ANYONE WHO HAD WITNESSED THE PERILOUS PASSAGE OF OTHER,EARLIER REVOLTS WITH LAUDABLE AMBITIONS, COULD ONLY HOPE THAT THEREBELS WOULD STOP THE SHOOTING AND START RUNNING THE COUNTRY . IN THELONG RUN, GUNS WILL HARDLY SERVE THE NEW REGIME BETTER THAN THEY SERVEDABDUL KARIM KASSEM .
