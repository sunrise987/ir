LAOS BECKONING THE UNDERTAKER " THE CLOUDS ARE STILL HANGING INTHE AIR AND THE WEATHER LOOKS BAD, " SAID A DIPLOMAT IN VIENTIANE LASTWEEK . HIS GLOOMY FORECAST WAS PROMPTED NOT BY THE UPCOMING RAINYSEASON, BUT BY THE FESTERING, COMMUNIST-INDUCED POLITICAL CRISIS THATIS SLOWLY TURNING " NEUTRAL " LAOS INTO A RED SATELLITE . FOR MONTHS ONTHE PLAINE DES JARRES, HEADQUARTERS OF BOTH THE NEUTRALIST ANDCOMMUNIST PATHET LAO ARMIES, THE REDS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY SQUEEZING THEIRFORMER NEUTRALIST ALLIES IN AN EFFORT TO DRIVE THEM OFF THE GRASSYPLATEAU . DEFYING LAST SUMMER'S 14-NATION GENEVA ACCORDS GUARANTEEINGLAOTIAN NEUTRALITY, THE PATHET LAO IS STILL REINFORCED BY COMMUNISTVIET MINH CADRES FROM NORTH VIET NAM ; TO THE NORTH OF THE PLAINE DESJARRES, RED CHINESE TROOPS ARE BUILDING ROADS LINKING CHINA WITHRED-CONTROLLED LAOS ITSELF . SLOWLY THE COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN PINCHINGOFF SUPPLIES TO NEUTRALIST ARMY LEADER GENERAL KONG LE AND BRIBING HISOFFICERS TO DEFECT . LAST WEEK, WITH KONG LE'S FOOD AND AMMUNITIONRATIONS DOWN TO THE TWO-DAY LEVEL, THE REDS, IN A BLAZE OF GUNFIRE,SLICED OFF ANOTHER CHUNK OF NEUTRALIST TERRITORY AT XIENGKHOUANG, JUSTSOUTH OF THE PLATEAU . " FOREIGN LACKEYS . " TROUBLE BEGAN WHEN THEPATHET LAO, SUPPORTED BY THE VIET MINH, OPENED FIRE ON A GROUP OF KONGLE'S SOLDIERS FISHING IN THEIR OFF-DUTY HOURS NEAR THE TOWN OF KHANGKHAY . THEN THE REDS ADVANCED ON THE NEUTRALIST STRONGHOLD ATXIENGKHOUANG, AND LAUNCHED A MORTAR BARRAGE THAT FORCED KONG LE'SFORCES OUT OF THE TOWN . WITH FULL-SCALE CIVIL WAR THREATENING TO BREAKOUT ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES, KONG LE EVACUATED THE WIVES AND CHILDRENOF HIS MEN TO THE LAOTIAN CAPITAL OF VIENTIANE, 120 MILES AWAY . AS THEBEDRAGGLED NEUTRALIST FORCES TRIED TO FIGHT THEIR WAY BACK TO THEPLATEAU FROM XIENGKHOUANG, THE REDS ATTACKED ONCE MORE WITH ARTILLERYAND BAZOOKAS, INFLICTING HEAVY LOSSES ON KONG LE'S TROOPS . THETREACHEROUS RED ATTACKS COMPLETED THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION OF KONGLE, WHO ONCE WAS THE DARLING OF MOSCOW AND PEKING . TWO AND A HALFYEARS AGO, KONG LE HAD JOINED FORCES WITH THE PATHET LAO ON THE PLAINEDES JARRES AND WITH THEM DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL THE WESTERNTROOPS IN LAOS . BUT CONSISTENTLY NEUTRALIST, KONG LE TODAY IS ASBITTERLY OPPOSED TO VIET MINH INTERVENTION IN LAOS AS HE HAD BEEN TOTHE PRESENCE OF U.S . MILITARY ADVISERS LAST OCTOBER . FORTNIGHT AGO HERAGED THAT THE VIET MINH WERE " FOREIGN LACKEYS " WHO HOPED TO MAKELAOS THEIR BASE TO SPREAD THEIR EVIL POLICIES THOUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA. HEART IN FRANCE . LAST WEEK KONG LE WAS DESPERATELY URGING HIS OLDRIGHT-WING FOES TO SEND TROOPS TO HIS AID ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES .BUT INEFFECTUAL NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA FEARED THAT ANY SUCHDETERMINED ACTION MIGHT UNGLUE HIS TOTTERING LEFT-RIGHT-CENTERCOALITION . SOUVANNA COULD NOT EVEN KEEP ORDER IN VIENTIANE, WHERE LASTWEEK ANOTHER TOP NEUTRALIST THE SECOND IN A FORTNIGHT WAS GUNNED DOWNIN HIS OWN HOUSE . " I DON'T KNOW WHICH FOOT TO DANCE ON, " SAIDSOUVANNA PLAINTIVELY . " I WISH I WAS ON THE SEASHORE IN FRANCE WITH MYFAMILY . " AT WEEK'S END, AFTER THE REDS HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR HOLD ONXIENGKHOUANG, THE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL COMMISSION OF CANADA, POLANDAND INDIA, WHICH HAD BEEN SET UP BY THE GENEVA CONFERENCE TO POLICELAOTIAN NEUTRALITY, FINALLY GOT APPROVAL FROM THE PATHET LAO TO FLYINTO THE PLAINE DES JARRES ON A PEACEMAKING MISSION . MEANWHILE THEU.S., SHUDDERING AT THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER MASSIVE MILITARY COMMITMENTIN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE ONSET OF THE RAINY SEASON WOULDSTALL OFF MAJOR HOSTILITIES . THE MOST THAT OPTIMISTIC U.S . OFFICIALSCOULD HOPE FOR IN LAOS WAS A CONTINUED STALEMATE ; REALISTS FELT,HOWEVER, THAT AN EVENTUAL COMMUNIST TAKEOVER WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. " ASKING WHAT YOU CAN DO SENSIBLY ABOUT LAOS IS LIKE ASKING A PATIENTCLOSE TO DEATH TO COME IN EVERY TWO MONTHS TO SEE WHAT HIS DOCTOR CANDO FOR HIM, " SAID ONE RANKING U.S . INSIDER . " AFTER A WHILE, THEREIS NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT CALL THE UNDERTAKER . /
