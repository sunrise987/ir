WEST GERMANY AN ECLIPSE OF PRINCES WHEN BRITAIN'S PRINCEPHILIP AND HIS DAUGHTER, PRINCESS ANNE, 12, CLAMBERED OUT OF THEIRRASPBERRY-PINK ROYAL PLANE AT FRANKFURT LAST WEEK, THERE WERE NOTOPHATTED OFFICIALS TO WELCOME THEM OR RESPECTFUL CROWDS CHEERING " ESLEBE HOCH .! " AFTER GREETING THEIR WAITING COUSINS, PRINCE LUDWIGAND PRINCESS MARGARET VON HESSEN, PHILIP AND ANNE GOT QUICKLY INTO THERAKISH ALVIS SPORTS COUPE, WHICH HAD BEEN FLOWN AHEAD OF THE ROYALPARTY FROM LONDON . THEN THEY HEADED DOWN THE AUTOBAHN TO DARMSTADT,WHERE THEY STAYED AT THE VON HESSENS' PALATIAL 18TH CENTURY SCHLOSSWOLFSGARTEN . THE BRITISH VISITORS' FOUR-DAY STAY MADE LITTLE STIR INWEST GERMANY AS A WHOLE, BUT THEIR PRESENCE WORKED LIKE CHAMPAGNE ONTHE ARISTOCRACY'S BATTERED MORALE . IN A SOCIETY WHERE MOST BLUEBLOODSFEEL THAT THEY ARE DISPLACED PERSONAGES (THERE HASN'T BEEN A KAISERSINCE 1918), THE ROMANTIK OF A ROYAL VISIT IS RARE INDEED . THANKS TOTHE NATION'S MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC BOOM, WEST GERMANS TODAY ARE MORECONCERNED WITH PAYCHECKS THAN WITH PRINCELY COMINGS AND GOINGS . BUTTHE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION HAS FAILED NOTABLY TOPRODUCE A UNIFIED, NATIONAL FUHRUNGSSCHICHT (LEADERSHIP LAYER) IN PLACEOF THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC RULING CASTE . THE RESULT IS A CONFUSED ANDCONFUSING SOCIETY IN WHICH, SAYS SOCIOLOGIST RALF DAHRENDORF, THERE ISNOT ONE CLASS OF PROMINENZ BUT " A MULTITUDE OF COMPETING GROUPS . "THE " PYRAMIDS OF POWER " INCLUDE THE CHURCH, THE MILITARY, LOCALGOVERNMENT AND SUCH VENERABLE UNIVERSITIES AS TUBINGEN, GOTTINGEN ANDHEIDELBERG, WHERE A HERR PROFESSOR COMMANDS UNDIMINISHED RESPECT FROMTHE COMMUNITY AT LARGE . SALON FROM FORD ? BY FAR THE MOST POWERFULAND CONSPICUOUS ELITE IN PRESENT-DAY GERMANY IS, OF COURSE, THEGELDARISTOKRATIE, THE NEW INDUSTRIAL PLUTOCRACY WHOSE YELLOW MERCEDESESAND CHRIS-CRAFT CRUISERS HAVE LARGELY REPLACED THE IRON CROSS AND THEDUELING SCAR AS STATUS SYMBOLS . THE NEW UPPER CRUST IS PERSONIFIED BYSUCH TYCOONS AS RUDOLF AUGUST OETKER, WHO PARLAYED A BAKING POWDERBUSINESS INTO A 100-COMPANY EMPIRE ; HANS GUNTHER SOHL, WHO AS BOSS OFTHYSSEN SINCE WAR'S END HAS TURNED A FAMILY IRONWORKS INTO WESTGERMANY'S BIGGEST STEELMAKER ; AND MUNICH'S RUDOLF MUNEMANN, ONE OFTHE NATION'S BIGGEST AND BOLDEST FINANCIERS . YET, FOR ALL ITS WEALTH,SAYS SOCIOLOGIST DAHRENDORF, THE GELDARISTOKRATIE " IS SEARCHING ABOVEITSELF IN THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY FOR ITS BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS . BUT THESPACE ABOVE IT IS EMPTY . " THIS, HE SUGGESTS, ACCOUNTS FOR THEJOYLESS, FRANTIC MATERIALISM THAT CHARACTERIZES MUCH OF POSTWAR GERMANLIFE " THE MEDIEVAL CHOIR STALL IN THE DINING ROOM, THE CONSPICUOUSCONSUMPTION, THE COMPLETE LACK OF TASTE IN ART AND LITERATURE . "COMPLAINS ONE SOPHISTICATED YOUNG PRINCESS : " IF THE FORD FOUNDATIONREALLY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING FOR GERMANY, IT SHOULD ENDOW A SALON INBONN . JUST A LITTLE SALON . THE OLD SOCIETY IS DEAD NOW . " VONS INVOLKSWAGENS . LIKE THE LAST GREAT AUKS WADDLING ACROSS THE TUNDRA, AFEW ANCIENT FAMILIES STILL SURVIVE IN THE FEUDAL SPLENDOR THEY ENJOYEDWHEN GERMANY WAS A PATCHWORK OF PETTY PRINCIPALITIES . IN FRANCONIA,CONVIVIAL COUNT FRANZ ERBACH PRESIDES OVER THREE FAMILY CASTLES (ONE ISKEPT FOR HUNTING PARTIES) ; AT DINNER, HIS LIVERIED CHIEF HUNTSMANSTATIONS HIMSELF BEHIND THE COUNT'S CHAIR TO SUMMON A FOOTMAN WHENEVERHIS MASTER'S WINEGLASS IS EMPTY . PRINCE EMICH ZU LEININGEN, 36, WHOSEESCUTCHEON IS AT LEAST 880 YEARS OLD, IS A GLOBE-TROTTING BIG-GAMEHUNTER WHO HONED HIS MARKSMANSHIP AS A YOUTH BY TAKING POTSHOTS ATFAMILY PORTRAITS IN HIS HANDSOME BAROQUE PALACE AT AMORBACH . MANY OLDBAVARIAN FAMILIES STUBBORNLY RESISTED THE NAZIS AND WERE SINGLED OUTFOR PERSECUTION BY HITLER ; AFTER THE WAR, THEY WERE ABLE TO RECLAIMTHEIR CONFISCATED HOLDINGS INTACT, AND EVER SINCE HAVE MANAGED TO KEEPTHE BOAR FROM THE DOOR WITH CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS . ONE OF THEIRLIVELIEST MEMBERS IS HANDSOME PRINCE " ALFIE " AUERSPERG, WHO WAS DOWNTO HIS LAST SCHLOSS A FEW YEARS AGO ; TODAY HE BOASTS A PRICELESSCOLLECTION OF FRENCH PAINTINGS AND A U.S . HEIRESS FOR A WIFE . BECAUSETHE BAVARIAN ARISTOCRATS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN LESS EXCLUSIVE THANPRUSSIA'S PATRICIANS, MUNICH TODAY IS ONE CITY IN WHICH THE RIVALELITES COME TOGETHER . MUNICH'S JET SET, COMPOSED OF THE NOUVEAU RICHEAND THE ANCIENT UPPER CRUST, SHUTTLES BETWEEN ST . MORITZ AND EGYPT'SRESORT OF HELWAN . ITS REIGNING BEAUTY IS THE STATUESQUE BLONDEDAUGHTER OF BANKER MUNEMANN, " ANTSCHI, " WHO HURTLES AROUND TOWN IN ANEGGSHELL-COLORED FERRARI ; HOWEVER, MANY FAMILIES WITH " VON " INTHEIR NAMES STILL PREFER TO DRIVE VOLKSWAGENS . " EVERYTHING, " SIGHS AJET-SET PRINCESS, " IS SO MIXED UP THESE DAYS . /TOP TEN THOUSAND . SCORES OFYOUNG BLUEBLOODS HAVE GONE TO WORK AND OFTEN BELIE THE ARISTOCRACY'STRADITIONAL REPUTATION FOR STUPIDITY . THE BOARDS OF BIG INDUSTRIALCOMPANIES ARE LIBERALLY STUDDED WITH NOBLE NAMES . THE NAMES AREPARTICULARLY IN DEMAND AS PUBLIC RELATIONS MEN . " I DO LIKE SNOBS, "EXCLAIMS ONE PRINCELY P.R . MAN . " THEY ARE ALL SO KIND TO ONE ! "TWO OF WEST GERMANY'S ABLEST JOURNALISTS ARE TITLED : COUNTESS MARIONDONHOFF, POLITICAL EDITOR OF HAMBURG'S WEEKLY DIE ZEIT, AND COUNT HANSWERNER FINCK VON FINCKENSTEIN, A CORRESPONDENT FOR DIE WELT . SAYS ONECORPORATE COUNT : " ALL YOU NEED TO GET AHEAD IN INDUSTRY ISREASONABLY GOOD LOOKS, SELF-ASSURANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL TALENT . THISTHE NOBILITY HAD, AND NOW THE YOUNG ONES ARE ALL FAT PEOPLE IN THEIRFIRMS . " GERMANY'S NOBILITY WAS LARGELY TO BLAME FOR ITS OWN DECLINE .HOLDING THEMSELVES ALOOF FROM POLITICS, BUSINESS AND THE INTELLECTUALWORLD, DIE OBEREN ZEHNTAUSEND (THE TOP TEN THOUSAND), AS BISMARCKCALLED THE ELITE, DEVOTED THEIR LIVES EITHER TO HUNTING OR TO THE ARMY; WHEN HINDENBURG JOINED THE CADET CORPS IN 1859, 2,000 OF 2,900PRUSSIAN OFFICERS WERE OF NOBEL BIRTH . HOWEVER, IN ITS EMPHASIS ON A "CITIZENS' ARMY, " WEST GERMANY'S GOVERNMENT HAS EVEN CLOSED OFF THISTIME-HONORED AVENUE FOR " ARISTOCRATIC SERVICE . " AS FAR BACK AS 1826,THE YEAR THAT CANNON KING FRIEDRICH KRUPP DIED, GOETHE BEWAILED A NEW "CENTURY OF ABLE MEN, " PROTESTING : " IT IS RICHES AND SPEED THAT THEWORLD ADMIRES AND STRIVES FOR . " THE FIRST KRUPP AND THE OTHER NEWTYCOONS WERE ESSENTIAL TO THE KAISERS' DREAMS OF EMPIRE ; THEARISTOCRATIC CLANS THAT ACCEPTED THEM WON NEW WEALTH AND A NEW LEASE ONLIFE . FINALLY DECIMATED BY TWO WORLD WARS, DENIGRATED BY HITLER'SFUNKTIONARSGESELLSCHAFT (SOCIETY OF FUNCTIONARIES), THEIR ECLIPSE WASSEALED BY THE POSTWAR PARTITION OF GERMANY . WORST HIT OF ALL WERE THEWEALTHY JUNKERS, THE BRAHMINS OF TEUTONIC SOCIETY, WHO LOST THEIR VASTTRACTS OF LAND IN THE EASTERN TERRITORIES AND IN MOST CASES CAME TOWEST GERMANY AS PENNILESS REFUGEES . COMPANY COUSINS . EVEN TODAY MANYOLDER ARISTOCRATS REGARD A BUSINESS CAREER AS NOT QUITE SALONFAHIG(SOCIALLY DESIRABLE) . AT A DINNER PARTY IN BONN LAST WEEK, ABESPECTACLED COUNT DREW SYMPATHETIC CLUCKS WHEN HE DECLARED : " ALL MYYOUNG COUSINS ARE IN INDUSTRY NOW . INCREDIBLE ! " ANOTHER ARISTOCRATHARRUMPHED RECENTLY : " THE GREAT PROBLEM IN GERMANY TODAY IS THATTHERE ARE NO GENTLEMEN IN THE GOVERNMENT . " IT IS TO WEST GERMANY'SCREDIT NONETHELESS THAT NOWADAYS TALENTS ARE APT TO COUNT FOR MORE THANTITLES . " HOW DO YOU GET AHEAD TODAY ? " ASKS A GREY-TEMPLEDINDUSTRIALIST . " IT'S EASY PROFICIENCY AND ELBOWS . " THIS NEW,ASSERTIVE SENSE OF SELF-CONFIDENCE HAS PENETRATED TO EVERY LEVEL OFGERMAN SOCIETY . INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THE OLD CLASS DIVISIONS ASPREORDAINED, SAYS SOCIOLOGIST HELMUT SCHELSKY, GERMAN WORKERS TODAYBELIEVE ALMOST RELIGIOUSLY IN THE SLOGAN : " ICH KANN DAS AUCH WERDEN(I CAN GET TO BE WHAT HE IS) . " THUS, DESPITE THE LAMENTS OF THEARISTOCRACY, ARGUES SCHELSKY, THE END OF THE OLD ORDER MAY PROVE TO BEA BLESSING AFTER ALL . " IF YOU WANT DEMOCRACY, " SAYS HE, " YOU CAN'TCOMPLAIN ABOUT THE LEVELING AND ATOMIZATION OF SOCIETY . I'M PRETTYOPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE . /
