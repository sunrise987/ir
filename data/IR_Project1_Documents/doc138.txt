EVER SINCE THE GERMANS HELPED NASSER TEST-FIRE HIS FIRSTSUCCESSFUL ROCKETS LAST JULY, ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS HAVE BEENCONDUCTING A DEADLY UNDERGROUND WAR TO FORCE OR FRIGHTEN THE GERMANSCIENTISTS AWAY FROM THE PROJECT . LAST MONTH TWO ISRAELI AGENTS WEREARRESTED IN SWITZERLAND AFTER THEY ALLEGEDLY PUT PRESSURE ON THE SONAND DAUGHTER OF DR . PAUL-JENS GOERCKE, A WEST GERMANELECTRONIC-GUIDANCE EXPERT EMPLOYED AT MILITARY FACTORY 333 .

BIGGEST UNSOLVED RIDDLE IS THE WHEREABOUTSOF DR . HEINZ KRUG, 49, BOSS OF A MUNICH FIRM THAT DEALT IN MILITARYHARDWARE FOR EGYPT . LAST NOVEMBER, KRUG VANISHED FROM HIS OFFICE INTHE COMPANY OF A POLITE STRANGER AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE .BACKTRACK IN BONN . TO CHARGES THAT ISRAEL IS BEHIND THE INCIDENTS,ISRAELI AUTHORITIES INSIST THAT THEIR AGENTS EMPLOY ONLY PEACEFULPERSUASION .
