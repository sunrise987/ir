CONFERENCES THE CITY OF LOST CAUSES GENEVA IS THEONLY CITY IN THE WORLD TO HAVE GAINED FAME AND PROSPERITY FROMSUCCESSIVE FAILURES . THIS PLACID, TIDY TOWN LYING ON THE SHORES OF LACLEMAN AND BENEATH MONT BLANC, THE TALLEST OF THE ALPS, HAS BEEN THESCENE OF SOME OF HUMANITY'S MOST TRYING MOMENTS . IT IS A PLACE WHEREGREAT IDEAS TURN TO DUST IN THE ARCHIVES, AND WHERE NATIONS EXHAUSTEDBY WAR COME TO END THEIR FIGHTING . LAST WEEK, LIKE EVERY WEEK, GENEVARESOUNDED WITH THE DIN OF WRANGLING DELEGATIONS . IN ANOTHER WEARYINGROUND OF THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN NEGOTIATIONS, THE WEST REFUSED TO SCALEDOWN FURTHER ITS DEMANDS FOR ON-SITE INSPECTIONS, WHICH STOOD AT 20ANNUALLY THREE YEARS AGO, EIGHT THIS WINTER, AND SEVEN LAST WEEK . THERUSSIANS, WHO ORIGINALLY REFUSED TO PERMIT ANY INSPECTIONS, THREE YEARSAGREED TO " TWO OR THREE, " AND LAST WEEK WOULD NOT GO HIGHER . ANEWSMAN WHO HAS COVERED GENEVA SINCE 1947 SAYS THAT HABITUAL ATTENDANCEAT EAST-WEST CONFERENCES RESULTS IN A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE ARGUMENTSOF BOTH SIDES : " YOU COME TO THINK THAT THE RUSSIANS OBJECT TOCONTROLS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CHEAT, AND THE WEST INSISTS ON CONTROLSBECAUSE THEY WANT TO SPY IN RUSSIA . YOU REACH THE CONCLUSION THATEVERYBODY IS EQUALLY WRONG . " IMPOSED DEADLINE . A CITY OF 182,000 ANDTHE BIRTHPLACE OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU, AS WELL AS OF THE RED CROSS,GENEVA GOT INTO THE CONFERENCE BUSINESS EARLY . DURING THE 16THCENTURY, UNDER REFORMER JOHN CALVIN, GENEVA WAS THE PROTESTANT ROME .IN 1872 GENEVA'S CITY HALL WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF A FIVE-MANCOMMISSION THAT ARBITRATED A DISPUTE BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE U.S . OVERTHE DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE BRITISH-BUILT CONFEDERATE RAIDER ALABAMA .THE LUCKLESS LEAGUE OF NATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN GENEVA IN 1920 .AFTER THE LEAGUE WAS ERASED BY WORLD WAR II, THE UNITED NATIONS TOOKOVER THE VAST PALAIS DES NATIONS AS ITS EUROPEAN BASE . GENEVA IS TODIPLOMATS WHAT NIAGARA FALLS IS TO HONEYMOONERS . EVERY MEETING OFEVERY CONFERENCE IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH ENDLESS, MULTILINGUAL TALK. ONLY RARELY DOES THE PALAIS, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST OFFICEBUILDINGS, COME TO LIFE WITH SUCH DRAMATIC MOMENTS AS EMPEROR HAILESELASSIE'S MOVING SPEECH AGAINST MUSSOLINI'S INVASION OF ETHIOPIA, ORTHE SIGHT OF FRENCH PREMIER PIERRE MENDES-FRANCE, WATCH IN HAND,SIGNING AT 4 A.M . THE ACCORD ENDING THE INDO-CHINA WAR TO MEET THEDEADLINE HE HAD SET HIMSELF ON TAKING OFFICE . 15 PER CENT JUMP . MOSTCONFERENCE ACTIVITY REVOLVES AROUND SUCH ANNUAL FIXTURES AS THE WORLDHEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE U.N . ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL . OVER170 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HEADQUARTERS IN GENEVA, RANGING FROM THEINTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF EDUCATION TO THE WORLD ALLIANCE OF THE Y.M.C.A. THROUGH MUCH OF FEBRUARY, 1,600 DELEGATES FROM ALL CORNERS OF THEEARTH SAT HAPPILY THROUGH LONG SESSIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONSCONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BENEFITOF THE LESS DEVELOPED AREAS, A GROUP KNOWN AS UNCSCAT FOR SHORT .MEETINGS MOST OFTEN OCCUR DURINGTHE GOOD WEATHER MONTHS, AND USUALLY AFFORD SUFFICIENT TIME OFF FORDELEGATES TO ENJOY THE DELIGHTS OF MOUNTAIN AND BEACH . THE PERMANENTU.N . EMPLOYEES IN GENEVA LEAD A QUIET, INCESTUOUS LIFE MADE UP OFINTIMATE COCKTAIL PARTIES, SMALL DINNERS AND CASUAL MEETINGS IN THEPALAIS BAR, WHICH SERVES SANDWICHES SO DISMAL THAT THEY ARE ALLEGED TOBE REJECTS FROM COMMERCIAL AIRLINES . THE CITIZENS OF GENEVA, WHO AREMOSTLY FRENCH-SPEAKING SWISS, IGNORE THE PERMANENT U.N . STAFF, THEDELEGATES AND THE TOURISTS, AND DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO MAKING WATCHES,PRECISION TOOLS AND, ESPECIALLY, MONEY . AN 18TH-CENTURY FRENCH FOREIGNMINISTER ONCE ADVISED A FRIEND, " IF YOU SEE A GENEVESE JUMP OUT OF AWINDOW, JUMP RIGHT AFTER HIM . THERE'S 15 PER CENT TO BE GAINED . " BUTAS SWISS CITIES GO, WHICH IS SLOWLY, GENEVA HAS A REPUTATION FORWILDNESS . IN BERN AND ZURICH THE SIDEWALKS ARE ROLLED UP AT MIDNIGHT,BUT GENEVA'S NIGHT SPOTS CAN STAY OPEN UNTIL 4 A.M . POLICE CANNOTBREAK INTO GENEVA HOTEL ROOMS AND ASK TO SEE MARRIAGE LICENSES AS THEYCAN IN MOST GERMAN SWISS CITIES . GENEVA HAS ONLY A FEW LICENSEDPROSTITUTES BUT NO SUSCEPTIBLE VISITOR HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN TO COMPLAINOF A LACK OF COMPLAISANT WOMEN . OCCASIONALLY, THERE ARE CRIMINALACTIVITIES . DURING THE 1960 DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE, SIR MICHAELWRIGHT, CHIEF BRITISH DELEGATE, FOUND A THIEF UNDER HIS BED . ANDCAMEROON'S PRO-COMMUNIST POLITICIAN, FELIX-ROLAND MOUMIE, DIED SUDDENLYAFTER DRINKING FOUR GLASSES OF PERNOD THAT SOMEONE HAD SPIKED WITH RATPOISON . POETIC CHEF . THE PROPRIETORS OF GENEVA'S 300 BARS AND 18NIGHTCLUBS, REPORT THAT ARAB, SOUTH AMERICAN AND AFRICAN DELEGATES LIVEIT UP THE MOST . COMMUNIST BLOC DELEGATES USUALLY REMAIN DOURLY BEHINDTHE HIGH STONE WALLS OF SUBURBAN VILLAS . ONE POPULAR BAR, THE NAVYCLUB, WAS FOUNDED BY U.S . NAVAL OFFICERS DETAILED TO THE 1954INDO-CHINA PEACE CONFERENCE . MOST RESTAURANTS ARE FRENCH AND VERY GOOD; DELEGATES WHO CAN AFFORD IT HAPPILY DRIVE 30 MILES TO THE FABULOUSAND EXPENSIVE LE PERE BISE, JUST ACROSS THE FRONTIER IN FRANCE ITSELF .IN GENEVA THERE ARE THREE CHINESE RESTAURANTS (ONE NATIONALIST AND TWORED CHINESE), A VIETNAMESE ONE WHOSE CHEF IS A POET, AND EVEN AN ARABEATING HOUSE, KNOWN FONDLY AS CHEZ FAROUK . FOR THE ATHLETIC, GENEVABOASTS AN AMERICAN-RUN TWELVE-LANE BOWLING ALLEY, AND FOR GAMBLERS, TWOCASINOS ; AND FOR THE PRURIENT, THERE IS A STRIPTEASE JOINT CALLED THEBA-TA-CLAN, WHOSE HUGE RED NEON SIGN WINKS WICKEDLY ACROSS FROM ST .PIERRE CATHEDRAL, WHERE CALVIN DELIVERED SERMONS LACED WITH FIRE ANDBRIMSTONE . FOR ROUES WHO WANT TO KEEP GOING EVEN AFTER 4 A.M., ASECOND-FLOOR ESTABLISHMENT NAMED THE U.N . BRIDGE CLUB SERVES DRINKSTILL DAWN AND POLISH LOVE SONGS RENDERED BY AN ITALIAN BARMAID .UNSIGNED TREATY . DESPITE THE SEEMING AIMLESSNESS OF MOST GENEVANEGOTIATIONS, THERE IS A RESIDUE OF IDEALISM AND OPTIMISM . LAST WEEKTHE BRITISH GAVE A FAREWELL PARTY FOR SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT UPON HISRETIREMENT AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NUCLEARTALKS REPRESENTATIVE . THERE WASAN ELEMENT OF SADNESS, SINCE SIR MICHAEL HAD PLAINLY HOPED TO END HISCAREER BY SIGNING THE EAST-WEST TREATY . NEWSMEN APPLAUDED WARMLY WHENSIR MICHAEL TURNED TO HIS GUEST, SENATOR HUBERT HUMPHREY, AND SAID, " IHOPE YOUR SIGNATURE WILL BE ON THE TREATY . " IF THE TREATY IS EVERSIGNED, GENEVA WILL HAVE LOST ITS PRESENT UNWANTED TITLE OF THE " CITYOF LOST CAUSES . /
