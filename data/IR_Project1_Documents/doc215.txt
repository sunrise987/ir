GREECE TRAVELING TALL THE GLORY THAT IS GREECE LAST WEEK PLAYEDHOST TO THE GRANDEUR THAT IS CHARLES DE GAULLE . FRENCH SURETE AGENTSFLEW IN AHEAD OF TIME TO GO OVER THE DOSSIERS OF RESIDENT FOREIGNERSAND EYE NEW ARRIVALS AT HELLENIKON AIRPORT . GREEK ARMY ENGINEERSPROWLED THE SEWERS OF ATHENS, SEARCHING FOR HIDDEN BOMBS ;GREY-UNIFORMED COPS STOOD GUARD 25 YARDS APART ALONG THE EIGHT-MILEPARADE ROUTE . EMOTIONALLY, A RETIRED GREEK GENERAL ANNOUNCED THAT HEWAS PERSONALLY READY TO SLASH HIS WRISTS TO GIVE BLOOD, IF DE GAULLEWERE SHOT . MORE PRUDENTLY, GREECE'S PREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS HADHIS OWN BLOOD TYPED, IN CASE HE GOT IN THE WAY OF ANY SHOOTING .DRIFTING SMOKE . IN THE EVENT, THE PRECAUTIONS SEEMED EXCESSIVE . DEGAULLE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AT NOON IN HIS BLUE-ANDWHITE CARAVELLE JETAIRLINER, INSPECTED AN HONOR GUARD AS CANNON SMOKE FROM THE 21-GUNSALUTE DRIFTED INTO HIS FACE, THEN CLIMBED INTO A ROLLS-ROYCECONVERTIBLE WITH GREECE'S TALL KING PAUL . AS THE MOTORCADE REACHED THECITY LIMITS, DE GAULLE JUMPED TO HIS FEET, WAVED THEATRICALLY TO THEATHENIANS GATHERED UNDER THE PEPPER TREES . AT HADRIAN'S ARCH, NEAR THETEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS, HE SAID WITH FEELING : " NO FRENCHMAN,ESPECIALLY MYSELF, COULD FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS CITY, NOR FORGET WHATHAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED HERE FOR LIBERTY IN 3,000 YEARS . " THEN HEPLUNGED NEARSIGHTEDLY INTO THE CURBSIDE CROWD TO SHAKE HANDS APROCEDURE THAT GIVES HIS SECURITY GUARDS PERPETUAL JITTERS . BUT THECHANCE OF A POTSHOT AT DE GAULLE WAS NOT THE ONLY WORRY OF GREEKLEADERS . THE GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO UNEASY THAT DE GAULLE MIGHT TRY TOEMBROIL GREECE IN HIS QUARREL WITH BRITAIN OVER THE COMMON MARKET, ANDWITH THE U.S . OVER NATO DEFENSE . IT WAS FRANCE, NOT GREECE, WHICH HADPUSHED THE TRIP . DE GAULLE HAD PICKED UP AN INVITATION MADE SEVENYEARS BEFORE TO THEN PRESIDENT RENE COTY . PARIS ALSO SUGGESTED THATTHE FRENCH FLEET DROP ANCHOR IN THE PIRAEUS TO COINCIDE WITH DEGAULLE'S ARRIVAL, AND DISCREETLY BROACHED THE PLAN OF HAVING DE GAULLEADDRESS THE GREEK PUBLIC, AS HE HAD DONE WITH SUCH SUCCESS DURING HISGERMAN TOUR LAST YEAR . WHEN GREEK REACTION TO BOTH IDEAS WAS COOL,THEY WERE ABANDONED . THE HINGE . NEVERTHELESS, GREECE WAS IN A MOOD TOBE WOOED BY LE GRAND CHARLES . ATHENS OFFICIALS WERE SHOCKED LASTSUMMER, WHEN THE $20 MILLION ANNUAL U.S . DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID WASABRUPTLY CUT OFF ON THE THEORY THAT THE GREEK ECONOMY NO LONGER NEEDEDIT . DE GAULLE IS SAID TO BE PREPARED TO CLIMAX HIS VISIT WITH AN OFFEROF A $10 MILLION DEVELOPMENT LOAN ; FRENCH INVESTMENTS IN GREECEALREADY TOTAL $60X MILLION AND ARE SECOND ONLY TO U.S . INVESTMENT . ATA PALACE BANQUET, DE GAULLE MADE CLEAR IN A TOAST TO KING PAUL THAT HEHOPES TO EXTEND FRANCE'S INFLUENCE FROM THE " NORTHERN SEAS, " WHICH HECALLED ONE OF FRANCE'S BOUNDARIES, TO THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN, WHERE,HE POINTED OUT, GREECE IS THE " HINGE BETWEEN THE LATIN AND SLAVICWORLDS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST . " THESEWORDS, AND DE GAULLE'S WOOING MANNER, SET DIPLOMATS EVERYWHERE TO AFRESH STUDY OF HIS UPCOMING AMBITIOUS TRAVEL PLANS : IN OCTOBER,CHARLES DE GAULLE, 72, IS SCHEDULED TO VISIT IRAN AND HE IS CONSIDERINGLATER TRIPS TO JAPAN, SOUTH AMERICA, NORTH AFRICA, AND THE NEWLYINDEPENDENT NATIONS OF BLACK AFRICA .
