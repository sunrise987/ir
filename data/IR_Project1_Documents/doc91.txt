" THIS IS THE S.A.O., " HE BARKED . "YES, THE S.A.O . WE'RE GIVING YOU ARGOUD . HE BETRAYED US, BUNGLED ALLTHE JOBS HE WAS SUPPOSED TO ORGANIZE, PARTICULARLY THE PETIT-CLAMARTAFFAIR . YOU CAN TAKE DELIVERY OF HIM NOW . HE'S IN A BLUE TRUCK IN THEALLEY OPPOSITE NOTRE-DAME . " MINUTES AFTER THE MAN HUNG UP AND STRODEOUT, THE SQUARE DE L'ARCHEVECHE STARTED FILLING WITH FRENCH POLICE .JUST AS THE MAN SAID, A SMALL DELIVERY TRUCK WAS PARKED IN THE ALLEY,AND INSIDE IT THE GENDARMES FOUND A GAGGED, TRUSSED, MIDDLEAGED MAN .LIFTING THE BLINDFOLD, A COP PEERED AT THE BATTERED, BLOODY FACE ANDNODDED : " IT LOOKS LIKE ARGOUD . " FASCHING FRAWL . EVER SINCE APRIL1961, EX-COLONEL ANTOINE-CHARLES-LOUIS-MARIE ARGOUD, 48, HAD BEEN ONEOF THE TERRORIST SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION'S TOP LEADERS . EARLIER, AS ASECTOR COMMANDER IN ALGERIA, HE WAS FAMED FOR HIS USE OF PSYCHOLOGICALWARFARE TACTICS AGAINST THE REBEL F.L.N . AN ARGOUD SPECIALTY :EXHIBITING IN THE STREETS BODIES OF EXECUTED MOSLEM PRISONERS AS AWARNING . AFTER LEAVING ALGERIA, HE GREW A BEARD AND SHUTTLEDANONYMOUSLY BETWEEN ITALY, GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND . ARGOUD HAD ALREADYBEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ABSENTIA FOR HIS PART IN THE 1961 GENERALS'PUTSCH, AND, AS A MEMBER OF THE DIEHARD COUNCIL OF NATIONAL RESISTANCE,IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ORDERED THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF DE GAULLE ATPETIT-CLAMART, OUTSIDE PARIS, LAST YEAR . SOON AFTER THE PARIS PRESSHEADLINED THE STORY OF THE ARREST, L'AFFAIRE ARGOUD WAS TURNED INTO AFIRST-RATE INTERNATIONAL WHODUNIT BY THE OWNER OF MUNICH'S HOTEL EDENWOLFF, WHO SAID THAT THE S.A.O . LEADER HAD CHECKED IN THERE THEPREVIOUS NIGHT . THREE HOURS AFTER HE HAD REGISTERED, SAID THEHOTELMAN, TWO MEN ENTERED THE LOBBY AND SENT A NOTE UP TO HIS ROOM .ARGOUD CAME DOWN AND SPOKE TO HIS VISITORS, WHO SHOWED HIM SOMETHING .ALL THREE STARTED OUT THE DOOR TOGETHER, BUT THEN ARGOUD TRIED TO PULLAWAY . THE OTHER TWO GRABBED HIM, HAULED HIM OUT TO THE STREET, KNOCKEDHIM DOWN, THREW HIM INTO AN AUTO AND DROVE AWAY . AT THE HEIGHT OFMUNICH'S RIOTOUS PRE-LENTEN CELEBRATIONS, ANY POLICEMAN MIGHT HAVESHRUGGED IT OFF AS JUST ANOTHER FASCHING BRAWL .LEGENDARY BEARDS . AS THEY READ THE HEADLINES, PARISIANS BEGAN TOQUESTION THE OFFICIAL VERSION THAT ARGOUD HAD BEEN BETRAYED BY THES.A.O . HOW HAD HE BEEN SMUGGLED FROM GERMANY INTO FRANCE ? WAS THEPHONE CALL REALLY FROM AN S.A.O . MAN ? COULD PIERRE CHATEAU-JOBERT,THOUGH SUPPOSED TO BE ARGOUD'S RIVAL FOR LEADERSHIP OF THE FOUNDERINGS.A.O., REALLY HAVE BETRAYED A COMRADE IN THIS WAY ? THE NEWSPAPERSPLUNGED GLEEFULLY INTO THE GUESSING GAME : ARGOUD, THEY SAID, HAD BEENCAPTURED BY LES BARBOUZES (THE BEARDED ONES), THE LEGENDARY TRIGGERMENOF THE FRENCH SECRET SERVICES . IT WAS SPECULATED THAT THE ESMERALDAPHONE CALL WAS SIMPLY THE GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF ESTABLISHING AN ALIBIAFTER ITS AGENTS HAD ILLEGALLY KIDNAPED ARGOUD IN GERMANY .ARGOUD'S ATTORNEY POINTEDLY CITED TWOSIMILAR " ILLEGAL " KIDNAPINGS : THAT OF ADOLF EICHMANN BY THEISRAELIS AND, EVEN MORE TO THE POINT, THAT OF THE EMIGRE DUKED'ENGHIEN, WHO, SUSPECTED OF PLOTTING AGAINST NAPOLEON, WAS SNATCHED INGERMANY BY FRENCH POLICE AND THEN TRIED AND EXECUTED . WHATEVER THETRUTH OF THE MATTER, PARISIANS AGREED THAT L'AFFAIRE ARGOUD WAS TRULYROCAMBOLESQUE, INCREDIBLE . TO CAP IT, POLICE LAST WEEK ROUNDED UP NINEOTHER S.A.O . MEN IN A PARIS APARTMENT, CHARGED THEM WITH HAVINGPLANNED (THOUGH THEY FAILED EVEN TO ATTEMPT) THE ASSASSINATION OFPREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU LAST YEAR . ARGOUD'S ARREST HAD ANOTHER RESULT: IT CAUSED A ONE-DAY ADJOURNMENT IN THE TRIAL OF NINE DEFENDANTS(TIME, FEB . 22) ACCUSED OF BEING PART OF THE GANG THAT TRIED TO KILLDE GAULLE AT PETIT-CLAMART . MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK TOESTABLISH THAT ARGOUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF NATIONALRESISTANCE, WHICH ORDERED THE AMBUSH AT PETIT-CLAMART, AND THE REST OFFRANCE WILL KEEP GUESSING WHO ACCOMPLISHED ARGOUD'S CAPTURE .
