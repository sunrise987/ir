FRANCE APRES DE GAULLE BLOSSOMING CHESTNUTS CAST THEIR SHADE OVERTHE BOOKSTALLS ALONG THE SEINE, TRAFFIC WHEELED INSANELY AROUND THEPLACE DE L'ETOILE, AND THE FIRST TOURISTS WITH THEIR CAMERAS SANKCONTENTEDLY LAST WEEK INTO CHAIRS AT SIDEWALK CAFES . BUT TO FRENCHPOLITICIANS, THE COMING OF SPRING MEANT REVIVAL OF THAT HEADYATMOSPHERE THEY CALL " APRES DE GAULLE . " WITH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONSJUST TWO YEARS AWAY, IT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRED TO MANY PUNDITSTHAT DE GAULLE MAY BECOME ILL, DIE, BE ASSASSINATED, OR JUST DECIDE NOTTO RUN . THE INFECTIOUS PRESIDENTIAL FEVER HAS SPREAD TO ALL PARTIES .ON THE NON-GAULLIST SIDE, POSSIBLE CANDIDATES RANGE FROM ANTOINE PINAY(AT 71, HE MAY BE TOO OLD) TO THE LAST PREMIER OF THE FOURTH REPUBLIC,PIERRE PFLIMLIN, TO THE GLIB RADICAL SPOKESMAN, MAURICE FAURE . THESOCIALISTS HAVE CONTENDERS IN VETERAN GUY MOLLET AND THE SHREWD,AFFABLE MAYOR OF MARSEILLE, GASTON DEFFERRE . MOST PROMINENT ON THEGAULLIST SIDE ARE PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY'STENNIS-PLAYING PRESIDENT JACQUES CHABAN-DELMAS AND EX-PREMIER MICHELDEBRE . RECENTLY ELECTED AS A DEPUTY FROM REUNION ISLAND, DEBRE CANNILYREFUSED THE CONFINING JOB OF FACTION LEADER OF THE GAULLISTS IN ORDERTO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS MR . FIXIT FOR PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. UNDER THE SPUR OF DEBRE'S COMPETITION, POMPIDOU IS NOW FUNCTIONINGMORE LIKE A POLITICIAN AND LESS LIKE A BANKER TURNED STATESMAN . INNATIONWIDE BROADCASTS, HE HAS PROVED TO BE A RELAXED, AVUNCULARPERFORMER AND HAS DISPLAYED WIT AS WELL AS COMPETENCE IN THE NATIONALASSEMBLY .
