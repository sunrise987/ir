BUT IN KENYA LAST WEEK, ASERIOUS, SENSIBLE AND LONG-CONSIDERED PLAN TOOK SHAPE . IN NAIROBI,NEWLY ELECTED PRIME MINISTER JOMO KENYATTA PRESIDED OVER A MEETING OFHIS NEIGHBORS .

FROMTHREE HOURS OF TALK EMERGED THE DECISION TO WORK FOR A FEDERATION OFKENYA, UGANDA, TANGANYIKA AND ZANZIBAR, WITH SOMALIA, RWANDA ANDBURUNDI ALSO INVITED . " WE HAVE A COMMON HISTORY, CULTURE AND CUSTOMSWHICH MAKE OUR UNITY BOTH LOGICAL AND NATURAL, " DECLARED KENYATTA,THEREBY SEEMING TO REFUTE OLD CHARGES THAT HE WAS PAROCHIALLYINTERESTED ONLY IN PUSHING THE FORTUNES OF HIS KIKUYU TRIBE, THE MOSTNUMEROUS IN KENYA .
