THE CONGO CAESARS OF THE BUSH AN ELDERLY SHOPKEEPER INELISABETHVILLE IGNORED OR PERHAPS DID NOT HEAR A CONGOLESE SOLDIER'SORDER TO GET OFF THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THE HEAVILY GUARDED NATIONALBANK OF KATANGA LAST WEEK . ANGRILY, THE SOLDIER HOISTED HIS RIFLE ANDSHOT HIM IN THE BACK . AS THE MAN LAY GROANING ON THE PAVEMENT,CONGOLESE TROOPS SHOVED AWAY A DOCTOR WHO TRIED TO SAVE HIS LIFE . THECOLD-BLOODED KILLING POINTED UP THE GRIM FACT THAT NEARLY THREE MONTHSAFTER UNITED NATIONS TROOPS CRUSHED SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE'S REGIMEAND PLACED THE PROVINCE UNDER PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA'S CENTRALGOVERNMENT, PEACE IS FAR FROM RESTORED IN KATANGA . EACH GUARD POSTTHAT THE U.N . HANDS OVER TO THE CENTRAL REGIME'S ARMEE NATIONALECONGOLAISE SEEMS TO PRODUCE A LITTLE AREA OF ANARCHY . IN RECENT WEEKS,TRIGGER-HAPPY A.N.C . SOLDIERS IN ELISABETHVILLE HAVE KILLED AT LEASTONE KATANGESE CIVILIAN PER DAY . BAREFOOT POLICE . THINGS ARE ALMOST ASCHAOTIC IN THE CONGO'S OTHER 17 PROVINCES, WHERE LOCAL BUSH CAESARS GOTHEIR OWN ANARCHIC WAYS UNIMPEDED BY CENTRAL AUTHORITY . IN COFFEE-RICHNORTH KIVU, PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT BENEZETH MOLEY MAINTAINS HEADQUARTERSIN ONE ROOM OF A GENERAL STORE, RUNS THINGS WITH A 300-MAN POLICE FORCERECRUITED FROM LOCAL TRIBESMEN . IN MANIEMA PROVINCE, COLD-EYEDPRESIDENT HILARIE KISANGA ENFORCES DISCIPLINE WITH 1,200 BAREFOOT COPSWHO LOUNGE IN THE STREETS ARMED WITH LEAD PIPES, AND WHO LIVE OFFON-THE-SPOT FINES IMPOSED ON PASSERS-BY . PROTESTS A SHOPOWNER : " YOUWALK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STREET AND YOU ARE FINED . YOU WALK ONTHE LEFT SIDE AND YOU ARE FINED . " THE AVERAGE CONGOLESE HAS LITTLELEGAL REDRESS . TODAY, IN A NATION THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF TEXAS, THEREARE ONLY 47 JUDGES TO HEAR COMPLAINTS ALL FOREIGNERS, IMPORTED BY THEU.N . FROM SUCH COUNTRIES AS EGYPT, SWEDEN, SPAIN AND SWITZERLAND .THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY PROBLEMS OF LEOPOLDVILLE'S PREMIER ADOULA. LACKING FUNDS AND TRAINED PERSONNEL, HE HAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTROL OVERHIS SPRAWLING NATION OF 17 MILLION LARGELY ILLITERATE PEOPLE . THECONGO'S ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN RIPPED APART BY TWO YEARS OFCIVIL WAR, AND THE CHIEF AIM OF THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT SOMETIMES SEEMSTO BE DESTRUCTION OF ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY . FOR MANY WEEKS, ADOULA'SGOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ON THE RAZOR'S EDGE OF DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OFLEOPOLDVILLE'S CHAOTIC LEGISLATURE, WHOSE DEBATES SOMETIMES VERGE ONTHE INSANE . FORTNIGHT AGO, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE RAGTAG CHAMBER OFDEPUTIES DISCUSSED THE CONGO'S PROPOSED NEW MOTTO " UNITY, JUSTICE,PROGRESS " ONE SPEAKER OPINED : " PROGRESS' IS NO GOOD . ONE CANPROGRESS BACKWARD AS WELL AS FORWARD . " RETORTED A FELLOW DEPUTY : "THAT GOES FOR " WORK' TOO . THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BAD WORK . " THENSILENCE FELL OVER THE CHAMBER AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BODY ROSE TOANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING. " WE HAVE JUST LEARNED, " HE INTONED, " THAT THIS MOTTO IS ALREADY INUSE BY WEST GERMANY . " AMID THE UPROAR THAT FOLLOWED, DEPUTIES WEREHEARD TO CRY, " WHO IS RESPONSIBLE, WHO ? "  FINALLY, A PORTLYDEPUTY NAMED EMILE ZOLA MOUNTED THE DAIS TO PLEAD : " SO MUCH THEBETTER . NOW WE WILL HAVE A TWIN COUNTRY IN THE WORLD . WE AREUNDERDEVELOPED ; GERMANY IS OVERDEVELOPED ; OUR BROTHERHOOD CAN ONLYLEAD TO A GOOD RESULT . " WITH THESE SHRILL CRIES RINGING IN THEIREARS, UNITED NATIONS OFFICIALS WENT NERVOUSLY AHEAD WITH PLANS TO PULLOUT NEARLY HALF OF THE U.N . CONGO FORCE'S PEAK STRENGTH OF 19,000TROOPS BY SUMMER'S END . THE CONGOLESE WOULD HAVE TO MATURE SOME DAY ;THEY MIGHT AS WELL BEGIN NOW .IGNORING THE PROTESTS OF A WEST GERMANEMBASSY OFFICIAL IN THE CORRIDOR WHO KEPT INSISTING, " NO, NO, IT'S ALLA MISUNDERSTANDING . OUR MOTTO IS " EINIGKEIT, RECHT, FREIHEIT' UNITY,JUSTICE, FREEDOM . /
