SENEGAL ONLY ONE HAT THREE MONTHS AGO, IN A BITTER END TO ABEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP, POET-PRESIDENT LEOPOLD SENGHOR OF PEANUT-GROWINGSENEGAL, ON THE WEST AFRICAN COAST, BOOTED OUT OF OFFICE HIS OLDFRIEND, PREMIER MAMADOU DIA, AFTER DIA HAD TURNED ON SENGHOR IN ANATTEMPTED COUP . LAST WEEK, IN A REFERENDUM RUN OFF WHILE DIALANGUISHED BEHIND THE BARBED WIRE OF A MILITARY CAMP OUTSIDE DAKARAWAITING TRIAL FOR TREASON, THE 56-YEAR-OLD SENGHOR LEGALIZED HISPOSITION AS SENEGAL'S STRONGMAN . WHILE PRO-SENGHOR DEMONSTRATORSCHANTED, " A SINGLE HAT ON A SINGLE HEAD, " MORE THAN 1,000,000SENEGALESE, SHUFFLED TO THE POLLS AND HANDED SENGHOR A 99.5 PER CENTOUI ON A NEW SENGHOR-TAILORED CONSTITUTION . TRUE TO THE SLOGAN, THENEW CHARTER SCRAPS SENEGAL'S TWO-MAN, PRESIDENT-PREMIER SYSTEM IN FAVOROF A SINGLE, STRONG PRESIDENCY FOR SENGHOR . THE VICTORY WAS RESOUNDINGPROOF OF SENGHOR'S SUPPORT AMONG SENEGAL'S MASSES, AND IT IS MADE ALLTHE MORE IMPRESSIVE BY THE FACT THAT HE IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC IN A 70 PERCENT MOSLEM LAND . BUT THE OUTCOME WAS ALSO, IN A SENSE, A PAINFULDEFEAT FOR BLACK AFRICA'S MOST DISTINGUISHED INTELLECTUAL . FOR IT HADBEEN THE BESPECTACLED SENGHOR WHO ORIGINALLY INSTALLED SENEGAL'STWO-HEADED SYSTEM OF DIVIDED POWERS AFTER LEADING THE COUNTRY INTOINDEPENDENCE 2F YEARS AGO . UNTIL HE AND DIA FELL OUT, FRENCH-ORIENTEDSENGHOR LOFTILY RIDICULED OTHER FRENCH AFRICAN NATIONS THAT HAD CHOSENONE-MAN RULE . NOW, WHATEVER HIS CONTINUING POPULARITY AT HOME, SENGHORHAS PROBABLY LOST SOME OF HIS EFFECTIVENESS AS THE LEADING SPOKESMANFOR POLITICAL LIBERALISM IN FORMER FRENCH AFRICA . THE BRILLIANTSENGHOR'S INTELLECTUAL CREDENTIALS ARE IMPRESSIVE INDEED . HISMUCHDISCUSSED POETIC WORKS INCLUDE CHANTS D'OMBRE, ETHIOPIQUES ANDNOCTURNES . WITH MARTINIQUE'S POET AIME CESAIRE, SENGHOR FOUNDED THEMYSTIC PHILOSOPHY OF " NEGRITUDE . " SENGHOR WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN EVERTO WIN FRANCE'S COVETED AGREGATION DE GRAMMAIRE ACADEMIC DEGREE, AND HESERVED WITH DISTINCTION AS A TERRITORIAL MEMBER OF THE POSTWAR FRENCHNATIONAL ASSEMBLY . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, HE HAS BEEN BROODING OVER THEPOLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH FORCED HIM TO END HIS 17-YEAR FRIENDSHIPWITH DIA AND TAKE OVER AS STRONGMAN . BUT SENGHOR WAS NOT LIKELY TO LETHIS SENSE OF GUILT GET HIM DOWN . HE IS, AFTER ALL, A STRONG ADMIRER OFCHARLES DE GAULLE, AND MODELED HIS NEW CONSTITUTION PARTLY ON DEGAULLE'S DESIGN FOR THE FIFTH REPUBLIC IN PARIS . PERHAPS WITH HISMENTOR IN MIND, SENGHOR CONCEDED IN ONE OF HIS POEMS THAT " ABSOLUTEPOWER REQUIRES THE BLOOD OF THE MOST DEAR BEING . " IN ANY CASE, BYWEEK'S END HE HAD GRANDLY CHRISTENED SENEGAL'S NEW REGIME, " LADEUXIEME REPUBLIQUE .HIS WIFE COLETTE, AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER 30S, IS FROM NORMANDY .
