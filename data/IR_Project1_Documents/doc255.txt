AUSTRIA HERR DOKTOR HE IS SHORT, BALDING AND MIDDLE-AGED .HE HAS A WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN AND LIVES IN A SPRAWLING SUBURBAN HOUSEOUTSIDE MUNICH . HE IS A LECTURER AND JOURNALIST WHO WROTE HIS DOCTORALTHESIS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE ON AGRICULTURE IN THE TYROL . BUT WHEN THE WAYWAS LEGALLY CLEARED FOR HIS RETURN TO HIS HOMELAND FOR THE FIRST TIMEIN 44 YEARS, AUSTRIA'S LONG-ESTABLISHED COALITION GOVERNMENT TREMBLEDLAST WEEK . FOR THE MUSTACHED HERR DOKTOR IS FRANZ JOSEPH OTTO RUPRECHTMARIA ANTON KARL MAXIMILIAN HEINRICH SIXTUS XAVER FELIX RENATUS LUDWIGGAETAN PIUS IGNAZ, ARCHDUKE OTTO VON HABSBURG, PRETENDER TO THEAUSTRIAN THRONE . SOCIALIST LEADERS CALLED OTTO'S PROJECTED RETURN A "PROVOCATION " THAT THREATENED AUSTRIA'S PRECARIOUS NEUTRAL POSITION ASA BUFFER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST . ELECTRICAL WORKERS WENT ON A WILDCATSTRIKE, PLUNGING ONE VIENNA DISTRICT INTO DARKNESS . LEFT-WING PAPERSROARED AGAINST " FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC REACTIONARIES, " AND SOCIALISTPOLITICAL BOSSES THREATENED TO PULL OUT OF THEIR COALITION WITH THECONSERVATIVE PEOPLE'S PARTY . INDUSTRIOUS ANTS . OTTO WAS FIVE WHENAUSTRIA REBELLED AGAINST THE HABSBURG MONARCHY AND OVERTHREW HISFATHER, EMPEROR KARL, IN THE AFTERMATH OF WORLD WAR I . THE NEWREPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT EXILED THE ROYAL FAMILY AND PASSED A " HABSBURGLAW, " WHICH BANNED THEIR RETURN TO AUSTRIAN SOIL UNTIL THEY RENOUNCEDALL CLAIMS TO THE THRONE AND FORMALLY EMBRACED THE DEMOCRATICCONSTITUTION . KARL REGALLY REFUSED, AND AFTER HIS DEATH IN 1922 THEROYAL FAMILY SETTLED IN SPAIN, WHERE THE EMPRESS ZITA SET UP A MODESTCOURT . ZITA INSISTED THAT OTTO BE ACCORDED THE FULL PRIVILEGES OF HISRANK, ROSE AND CURTSIED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM, AND CALLED HIM " YOURIMPERIAL HIGHNESS . " A THOUGHTFUL, SCHOLARLY YOUTH, OTTO STUDIED ATBELGIUM'S LOUVAIN UNIVERSITY, BY HIS SERIOUS DEMEANOR STOOD OFFPHALANXES OF ELIGIBLE EUROPEAN PRINCESSES . WHEN ONE YOUNG, ATTRACTIVEHUNGARIAN COUNTESS CAME TO PAY HOMAGE, OTTO STROLLED SILENTLY WITH HERFOR SOME MINUTES IN HIS GARDEN UNTIL HE SUDDENLY ASKED : " HAVE YOUEVER THOUGHT HOW INDUSTRIOUS ANTS ARE ? " FINALLY IN 1951, AT 38, HEMARRIED GERMANY'S PRINCESS REGINA OF SAXEMEININGEN . SETTLING OUTSIDEMUNICH IN THE VILLAGE OF POCKING, OTTO TRAVELED OFTEN TO SPAIN, WHEREHE WAS HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE FRANCO-BACKED EUROPEAN DOCUMENTATIONAND INFORMATION CENTER, AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN 1952 TO BRINGPOLITICALLY ISOLATED SPAIN INTO CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE REST OFEUROPE . HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THIS SOCIETY AND HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH FRANCOCONVINCED AUSTRIAN SOCIALISTS THAT HIS ULTIMATE AIM WAS THERE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUTOCRATIC MONARCHY IN AUSTRIA . " THE IDEAMATTERS . " IN HIS WRITING AND LECTURES, OTTO SOUNDED FAR FROMAUTOCRATIC, SOUGHT TO DEFINE " MONARCHY'S PLACE IN THE ATOMIC AGE . "SAID HE : " THE NEW FORM OF MONARCHY MIGHT WELL BE ELECTIVE FROM THEJUDICIARY, PERHAPS . ITS PRIMARY DUTY WOULD BE THE MAINTENANCE OF THERULE OF LAW . IT IS THE IDEA THAT MATTERS, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ONCE WEREKINGS . " BUT OTTO HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY WITH THE LEVELING INFLUENCES OFSOCIALISM . " WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A BUREAUCRACY OF WELFARE AND INSURANCEAGAINST EVERYTHING, WHICH MAY WELL TURN REASON INTO NONSENSE, " HEWROTE . " THERE IS A DANGER OF A NEW CASTE ARISING OUT OF A CLASSLESSSOCIETY THOSE IN POWER . " TWO YEARS AGO, OTTO SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED HISWILLINGNESS TO ABIDE BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE HABSBURG LAW AND SOUGHTTO RE-ENTER AUSTRIA . BUT AUSTRIA'S COALITION GOVERNMENT, BALANCEDBETWEEN THE 81 PARLIAMENTARY SEATS HELD BY THE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE'SPARTY AND THE 76 SEATS HELD BY THE SOCIALISTS, REFUSED TO ACT ON THEPETITION IN THE FACE OF VEHEMENT SOCIALIST PROTESTS THAT OTTO'SPOLITICAL IDEAS WERE " FANTASTIC " AND THAT HIS DECLARATION OF LOYALTYWAS INADEQUATE . OTTO'S ATTORNEY TOOK THE CASE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVECOURT, WHICH FORTNIGHT AGO UPHELD THE LEGALITY OF HIS DECLARATION OVERTHE GOVERNMENT'S REJECTION . PUSHBUTTON . THE PEOPLE'S PARTY, WHILE FARFROM EAGER TO SEE OTTO BACK HOME, WAS WILLING TO ABIDE BY THE COURTRULING . NOT SO THE SOCIALISTS . " THIS COURT HAS REPLACED THEPARLIAMENTARY ORGAN, " SAID SOCIALIST FOREIGN MINISTER BRUNO KREISKY .SOCIALIST LEADERS HINTED A NATIONWIDE RAIL AND ELECTRICAL STRIKE IFOTTO TRIED TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO AUSTRIA . " ALL WE HAVE TO DO, "SAID KREISKY, " IS PUSH A BUTTON . " IN PARLIAMENT, THE SOCIALISTSJOINED WITH THE EIGHT-MAN DELEGATION OF THE SPLINTER RIGHT-WING LIBERALPARTY AND FORCED A RESOLUTION DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT PREPARE ABILL THAT COULD RETURN ULTIMATE JUDGMENT ON ALL HABSBURG LAW CASES TOPARLIAMENT . THE LIBERALS LENT THEIR SUPPORT TO THE SOCIALISTS,HOWEVER, ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT THE BILL NOT BE RETROACTIVE ANDTHAT OTTO WOULD NOT BE BARRED FROM RETURNING HOME. THE CRISISIMPERILED THE 18-YEAR COALITION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE'S PARTY AND THESOCIALISTS, WHO KEPT THREATENING TO FREEZE OUT THEIR OLD PARTNERS BYFORMING A NEW COALITION WITH THE LIBERALS . EVEN IF THE OLD COALITIONSURVIVES, THE BETTING WAS THAT ENOUGH TROUBLE HAD BEEN STIRRED UP TOREQUIRE NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS SOON . WHILE MOST AUSTRIANS RETAINMELLOW FEELINGS TOWARD THE HABSBURGS, THEY WOULD JUST AS SOON NOT BEBOTHERED BY OTTO'S PROBLEM . " WHY SHOULD WE GO BACK TO WHERE WEFINISHED 40 YEARS AGO ? " ASKED HELMUT QUALTINGER, FAMED VIENNACABARET SATIRIST . " I THINK THAT AS A MATTER OF TASTE, OTTO WOULD NOTWANT TO COME BACK NOT IF HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY . /ALSO UNSETTLED ISTHE QUESTION OF THE HABSBURG FORTUNE IN AUSTRIA, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME$30 MILLION, MOSTLY IN ESTATES . THE LANDS ARE NOW HELD IN TRUSTEESHIPBY THE AUSTRIAN REPUBLIC .
