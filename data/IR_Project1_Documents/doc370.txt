GENERAL DUONG VAN ( " BIG " ) MINH FIRST MOVEDTO CONSOLIDATE THEIR VICTORY . REPORTEDLY THEY EXECUTED THE CAPTUREDCOMMANDER OF DIEM'S ELITE SPECIAL FORCES, COLONEL LE QUANG TUNG, HISBROTHER, THE SPECIAL FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF, MAJOR LE QUANG TRIEU, AND AFORMER LEADER OF DIEM'S REPUBLICAN YOUTH .

WEARING TATTEREDCLOTHES BUT CARRYING A VALISE CONTAINING CASH, CAN SOUGHT REFUGE IN THEU.S . CONSULATE, ONLY TO BE TURNED OUT AFTER THE STATE DEPARTMENTRECEIVED ASSURANCES THAT THE GENERALS WOULD ALLOW HIM " DUE PROCESS OFLAW . "  THE NEW REGIME'S MOST EMBARRASSING PROBLEM WAS TWO CORPSESTHOSE OF DIEM AND HIS BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU . THE OFFICIAL TALK OFSUICIDE WAS OBVIOUSLY PHONY (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) . AT THE BEGINNING,THE GENERALS APPARENTLY TRIED TO SPARE THE BROTHERS' LIVES, BUT AFTERDIEM ESCAPED FROM THE PALACE, THE JUNTA EVIDENTLY FELL BACK ON THEPHILOSOPHY OF 19TH CENTURY BRITISH POET ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH : THOUSHALT NOT KILL ; BUT NEED'ST NOT STRIVE OFFICIOUSLY TO KEEP ALIVE .DIEM'S ELDESTBROTHER, NGO DINH THUC, 66, ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF HUE, WAS INROME ATTENDING THE ECUMENICAL COUNCIL . ANOTHER BROTHER, NGO DINHLUYEN, 49, WAS IN LONDON, WHERE HE RESIGNED AS AMBASSADOR TO THE COURTOF ST . JAMES'S . DIEM'S 92-YEAR-OLD MOTHER REMAINED IN SAIGON,UNMOLESTED .THREE STRONGMEN . FOR THELIVING, THERE REMAINED THE TASK OF PUTTING TOGETHER A GOVERNMENT .PREMIER NGUYEN NGOC THO, DIEM'S LONGTIME VICE PRESIDENT, APPOINTED NINECIVILIAN MINISTERS MOSTLY NONPOLITICAL CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE OLD REGIME. TO COUNSEL THO'S GOVERNMENT, THE BRASS NAMED A 15-MAN " COUNCIL OFSAGES, " INCLUDING BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL LEADERS . BUT IT IS THEMILITARY THAT IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY . LIEUT . GENERAL TRAN VAN DON,46, THE POLISHED, FRENCH-SCHOOLED STAFF OFFICER WHO HELPED MASTERMINDTHE COUP, WAS APPOINTED DEFENSE MINISTER . MAJOR GENERAL TON THAT DINH,36, THE AGGRESSIVE, VAIN COMMANDER OF THE SAIGON DISTRICT, WAS NAMEDMINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY, WHICH GIVES HIM CONTROL OF NGO DINH NHU'SSECRET POLICE . OVER BOTH THE CABINET AND THE " SAGES " IS THE REBELOFFICERS' 23-MEMBER " MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE, " WHICH LASTWEEK DECREED THAT " THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS ARECENTRALIZED " IN ITSELF, AND NAMED GENERAL " BIG " MINH CHIEF OF STATE. WITHIN THE COMMITTEE IS A TWELVE-MAN INNER COUNCIL, WITH BIG MINH ASCHAIRMAN, DON AND DINH AS VICE CHAIRMEN OBVIOUSLY THE RULINGTRIUMVIRATE . THE GENERALS PROMISED THAT WHEN " ALL DEMOCRATICINSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SET UP, " THE REBELS WILL " TRANSFER ALL THEPOWERS BACK TO OUR ENTIRE PEOPLE, " HINTED AT ELECTIONS WITHIN A YEAR .IN THE MEANTIME, AS MANY POLITICAL SHADES AS POSSIBLE WILL BEREPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT, BUT, SAID DEFENSE MINISTER DON, " WEDON'T WANT ANY NEUTRALISTS . " BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT, THE REGIMELIFTED MARTIAL LAW AND CENSORSHIP . FIRST TO RECOGNIZE SOUTH VIET NAM'SNEW GOVERNMENT WERE MALAYSIA AND THAILAND, FOLLOWED BY GREAT BRITAINAND THE U.S., WHICH ALSO PREPARED TO RESTORE A $12 MILLION-A-MONTHIMPORT AID PROGRAM SUSPENDED UNDER DIEM . FOUR TIGERS . THE MOSTSERIOUS DANGER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS POTENTIAL RIVALRY AMONG THEGENERALS . THE FIRST HINTS OF THIS WERE ALREADY APPEARING AS LITTLEMAJOR GENERAL TON THAT DINH INJECTED HIMSELF INTO THE LIMELIGHT WITHAMAZING SPEED . IN THE FIRST WEEK OF VICTORY, SECURITY MINISTER DINHCONDUCTED SEVERAL PRESS CONFERENCES OF HIS OWN, AND DURING ONEINTERVIEW, WHILE PROTESTING THAT " WE MUST STAY AS ONE, " DINHINSINUATED THAT BIG MINH WAS REALLY ONLY HIS " FRONT MAN . " BUT THEU.S . IS BETTING THAT, FOR AT LEAST HALF A YEAR OR SO, THE GENERALSWILL STAND TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE HIGH HOPES FOR A MORE VIGOROUS, MOREEFFICIENT PURSUIT OF THE WAR AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, WITH MORE AUTONOMYFOR LOCAL COMMANDERS THAN ALLOWED BY DIEM . SAID BIG MINH : " OUR MAINPROBLEM IS TO MAKE THE POPULATION HAPPY . THIS AND THE MILITARY PROBLEMARE INTERTWINED . IF THE POPULATION DOES NOT FEEL PROTECTED, IT WILL GOOVER TO THE VIET CONG . " IN THE WAR, THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG STEPPEDUP PROBING ACTIONS, BUT BIG MINH & CO . ORDERED A NEW CORPS COMMANDERINTO THE MEKONG DELTA, ALSO REPLACED THREE DIVISION CHIEFS . SAID ONEPLEASED AMERICAN ADVISER : " THEY ARE PUTTING SOME YOUNG TIGERS OUTTHERE . " RED NORTH VIET NAM'S RADIO CHARGED THAT " U.S . IMPERIALISTSSCHEMED THROUGH THE RECENT COUP TO REPLACE THE INEFFICIENT NGO DINHDIEM CLIQUE BY OTHER HENCHMEN WHO CAN SERVE MORE EFFECTIVELY THEIRAGGRESSIVE WAR . " IT WAS A HANDSOME TESTIMONIAL FROM THE ENEMY .ON THE PHONE .U.S . ADMIRAL HARRY FELT KEPT AN APPOINTMENTWITH DIEM IN SAIGON ON THE DAY SET FOR THE COUP, A VISIT SCHEDULED ATLEAST A MONTH PREVIOUSLY . HE AND U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGESTEPPED INTO DIEM'S OFFICE AT 10 A.M., APPARENTLY UNAWARE THAT HALF ANHOUR BEFORE KEY TROOPS HAD BEGUN MOVING INTO POSITION FOR THE COUP .THEY STAYED WITH DIEM UNTIL WELL PAST 11 A.M . AS LODGE, WHO WAS TOLEAVE FOR WASHINGTON THE FOLLOWING DAY, TOOK HIS FINAL DEPARTURE, DIEMREMARKED : " EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR GOES AWAY, THEY TRY TOPULL A COUP . " GENERAL DON SAW ADMIRAL FELT OFF AT THE AIRPORT ALITTLE ANXIOUSLY, FOR THE AIRPORT ITSELF WAS SCHEDULED TO BE SEIZED INJUST 90 MINUTES . DON THEN WENT ON TO THE GENERALS' LUNCH . AT 1 : 30P.M . SHARP, THE INSURGENT FORCE STRUCK, WITH RED-KERCHIEFED GENERALDINH BARKING THE ORDERS . DON WAS ASSIGNED TO KEEP LODGE INFORMED,WHILE BIG MINH SUPERVISED THE WHOLE SHOW . THE GENERALS DELIBERATELYKEPT PHONE LINES OPEN TO THE PALACE AND TO THE U.S . EMBASSY . THEPALACE SWITCHBOARD (SAIGON 21584) AND PARTICULARLY DIEM'S DIRECT LINE(23126) BUZZED WITH TELEPHONIC FRUSTRATION . WITH THE GUARD BARRACKSAND THE PALACE BOTH UNDER SIEGE, DIEM AT 4 : 30 P.M . CALLED LODGE TOASK FOR U.S . HELP AGAINST THE INSURGENTS . LODGE REPLIED : " I'MCONCERNED FOR YOUR SAFETY, " ASKED IF DIEM AND HIS BROTHER WOULD TAKEADVANTAGE OF THE INSURGENTS' OFFER OF SAFE-CONDUCT OUT OF VIET NAM . "I SHALL DO WHAT DUTY AND GOOD SENSE INDICATE MUST BE DONE, " DIEMREPLIED STIFFLY . " I SHALL TRY TO RESTORE ORDER . " HE HUNG UP . ATCHURCH . HALF AN HOUR LATER, THE INSURGENT GENERALS CALLED DIEM TO THEPHONE . ONE BY ONE, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES, THEY ASKED HIM TO RESIGNAND SURRENDER . FINALLY, BIG MINH DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM : " GIVE UPIN FIVE MINUTES OR THE PALACE WILL BE BOMBED . " DIEM STOOD FIRM, ANDTHE GENERALS, STILL RELUCTANT AT THAT POINT TO RISK KILLING HIM, HELDTHEIR FINAL BLOW . AT 8 : 13 P.M., DIEM AND NHU LEFT THE PALACE NOTTHROUGH ESCAPE TUNNELS, AS WIDELY RUMORED . THEY SIMPLY WALKED OUT,EACH WITH AN AIDE, AND GOT INTO INCONSPICUOUS SEDANS . AT THAT POINTTHE REBELS HAD NOT YET SEALED OFF THE PALACE, WERE STILL PASSINGCIVILIANS WHO LIVED ON THE GROUNDS, AND SO THE BROTHERS MANAGED TODRIVE THROUGH UNNOTICED . THEY RENDEZVOUSED AT A VILLA IN SUBURBANCHOLON OWNED BY BUSINESSMAN MA TUYEN, LEADER OF THE LOCAL CHINESECOMMUNITY . DIEM AND NHU SPENT THEIR LAST NIGHT IN THE CHINESEBUSINESSMAN'S VILLA, ACTUALLY TOOK CALLS THROUGH THE PALACE SWITCHBOARDSO THAT THE INSURGENT GENERALS WOULD THINK THEY WERE STILL THERE . LATEFRIDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY, THE GENERALS CALLED AGAIN AND TOLD DIEMTHAT HIS LAST HOPE OF BEING RESCUED BY LOYAL TROOPS FROM OUTSIDE SAIGONWAS GONE ; GENERAL HUYNH VAN CAO, COMMANDER OF IV CORPS IN THE MEKONGDELTA AND THE LAST TO HOLD OUT, HAD COME OVER TO THE REBELS . WHEN DIEMAGAIN REFUSED TO SURRENDER, THE REBEL GENERALS MOUNTED THE FINALASSAULT . THE PALACE FELL, WITH NEITHER DIEM NOR NHU INSIDE . SATURDAYMORNING, ALL SOULS' DAY, THE BROTHERS WENT TO CHOLON'S ST . FRANCISXAVIER CHURCH, ARRIVING AT 8 : 45 . THEY WALKED IN, KNELT AND TOOKCOMMUNION . THE JUNTA WAS TIPPED OFF BY AN INFORMER . MINUTES LATER ANM-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER ROARED UP TO THE CHURCH AND THE CAPTAININ CHARGE ORDERED THE BROTHERS TO GET IN . AT HEADQUARTERS . SAIGONSTILL HUMS WITH RUMORS THAT DIEM AND NHU WERE ASSASSINATED IN THEARMORED CAR . ACCORDING TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS DISCARDED THEORIGINAL VERSION OF SUICIDE, NHU PROVOKED THE CAPTAIN BY INSULTING HIM,AND IN AN ENSUING SCUFFLE OVER A GUN, BOTH BROTHERS WERE KILLED . THEGOVERNMENT NOW CALLS THIS " ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE, " AND IT IS INTERESTINGTO SPECULATE WHAT U.S . REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN IF DIEM HAD PUT OUTSUCH A STORY ABOUT THE DEATH OF SOME PRISONERS OF HIS OWN . ACCORDINGTO THE MOST RELIABLE ACCOUNT, THE BROTHERS DIED QUITE DIFFERENTLY .THEY WERE DRIVEN DIRECTLY TO JOINT GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, WHERETHEY WERE TAKEN INTO A ROOM WITH " SEVERAL GENERALS . " DIEM WAS HANDEDA TAPERECORDER MICROPHONE AND TOLD TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT HE WASRESIGNING THE PRESIDENCY . DIEM THREW THE MICROPHONE DOWN AND SAID : "I WILL NOT RESIGN . I AM THE PRESIDENT . YOU ARE GUILTY OF TREASON . "AT THIS POINT, NHU LEAPED INTO THE ARGUMENT, CURSING . ONE OF THEGENERALS BACKED AWAY, DREW A PISTOL AND BEGAN SHOOTING . THEBULLET-RIDDLED BODIES WERE PUT BACK IN THE ARMORED CAR AND TAKEN OFF TOST . PAUL'S HOSPITAL . LAST WEEK THE BODIES WERE CLAIMED BY A RELATIVEOF DIEM'S, PLACED IN HERMETICALLY SEALED METAL CASKETS, AND TAKEN BACKTO COUP HEADQUARTERS .
