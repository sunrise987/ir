JAPAN TWO PINS JAPAN'S DISASTER TOLL LAST WEEK STOOD AT 450 INTHE KYUSHU MINE EXPLOSION, AND 162 IN THE THREE-TRAIN WRECK NEARYOKOHAMA . AS FAR AS ANYONE COULD DETERMINE, BOTH TRAGEDIES RESULTEDFROM FAULTY COTTER PINS, ONLY AN INCH OR TWO LONG . AT THE MIKAWA MINEON SOUTHERN KYUSHU ISLAND, A COTTER PIN APPARENTLY FELL OUT OF ACOUPLING ON A STRING OF COAL CARS HALTED ON A SLIGHT INCLINE . ONE COALCAR ROLLED BACK DOWN INTO THE MINE . GATHERING SPEED, IT FLEW OFF THETRACK ON A CURVE IN THE TUNNEL AND STRUCK THE MINE WALL, SHOWERING THEFATAL SPARKS THAT IGNITED COAL DUST IN A VAST EXPLOSION . AT TSURUMI,OUTSIDE YOKOHAMA, ANOTHER COTTER PIN EVIDENTLY SHEARED OFF THE WHEELHOUSING OF A SOUTHBOUND FREIGHT CAR . THE LOOSE LOST WHEEL CAUSED THELAST THREE CARS TO DERAIL AND SPRAWL ACROSS THE ADJACENT TRACK .SECONDS LATER, ALERTED BY A WARNING FLARE, A PASSENGER TRAIN SOUTHBOUNDFROM TOKYO HALTED ON A CLEAR TRACK BESIDE THE FREIGHT . AT THAT MOMENT,A NORTHBOUND COMMUTER TRAIN ROARED UP THE MIDDLE TRACK . THE LOCOMOTIVECRASHED INTO THE DERAILED FREIGHT CARS, DID A RIGHT ANGLE FLIP ANDSLICED THROUGH THE FIFTH AND SIX COACHES OF THE PASSENGER TRAIN . THEFIRST RESCUERS RECOILED FROM THE CARNAGE . RECALLED ONE : " THERE WEREBODIES PILED FOUR TO SIX DEEP . THERE WERE LEGS, ARMS AND HEADS TORNOFF, ALL BLOODY, SCATTERED EVERYWHERE . IT WAS A HORRIBLE HUMAN VERSIONOF A DOLL REPAIR SHOP . " WITH NATIONAL ELECTIONS BEING HELD THIS WEEK,THE SOCIALIST OPPOSITION HURRIEDLY TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL CAPITAL OFTHE TRAGEDIES . AN OFFICIAL SOCIALIST STATEMENT BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT,WHICH OPERATES THE RAILWAYS, AND THE PRIVATE OWNERS OF THE MINE FOR "HAVING PLACED TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON EFFICIENCY AND PROFIT AND NOT ENOUGHON THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PASSENGERS AND EMPLOYEES . " THE MINEOWNERS, WHO USED TO BOAST TO FOREIGN VISITORS THAT THE MIKAWA WAS AN "UNDERGROUND PALACE, " COULD HAVE RETORTED THAT GOVERNMENT INSPECTORSHAD FOUND MIKAWA TO BE AMONG THE BESTEQUIPPED MINES IN THE COUNTRY .THE GOVERNMENT COULD POINT OUT THAT THE STRETCH OF TRACK WHERE THECOLLISION OCCURRED WAS EQUIPPED WITH MODERN SAFETY DEVICES BUT THEYPROVED USELESS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CHAIN OF EVENTS, FROM THE DERAILMENTOF THE FREIGHT CARS TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE THIRD TRAIN, TOOK LESS THAN30 SECONDS . FEW JAPANESE HAD HEART TO ENTER THE ARGUMENT ; THEY WERETOO BUSY BURYING THE DEAD AND WORRYINGABOUT THE SURVIVORS . OF THE 274 HOSPITALIZED MINERS, AN ALARMING 100WERE SUFFERING FROM AMNESIA . AS TRAFFIC RESUMED ON THE TOKYO-YOKOHAMALINE, THE TRAINS MOVED SLOWLY PAST TSURUMI AND SOBBING PASSENGERSDROPPED BOUQUETS AT THE ACCIDENT SPOT . RAILWAY WORKERS COLLECTED THEFLOWERS AND REVERENTLY ARRANGED THEM ON AN EMBANKMENT BESIDE THE TRACK
