RED CHINA TURNING THE SCREW HE WAS AN OBSCURE TRUCK DRIVER UNTILHE WAS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT LAST AUGUST, BUT TODAY LEI FENG IS REDCHINA'S NEWEST FOLK HERO . OTHERWISE CELEBRATED AS THE FOREVERRUSTPROOF SCREW, YOUNG COMMUNIST LEI FENG SOARED TO POSTHUMOUS FAMEWHEN PARTY OFFICIALS CONVENIENTLY DISCOVERED A200,000-WORD DIARY THATESTABLISHED HIM AS THE CONFUCIUS OF COLLECTIVISM . BY CONTRAST WITH THEVAST MAJORITY OF CHINA'S PEASANTS, WHOSE RELUCTANCE TO BE HERDED INTOAGRICULTURAL COMMUNES IN 1958 HAS BEEN LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THENATION'S PERSISTENT FOOD SHORTAGES, LEI FENG ACTUALLY WAXED LYRICALOVER SUCH SELFLESS, SOULLESS " SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE . " SAID HE : "ONE'S ROLE IN THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE IS JUST LIKE A SCREW IN THEMACHINE . A MAN HAS HIS GREATEST STRENGTH ONLY WHEN HE IS MERGED WITHTHE COLLECTIVE . " WITH A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD SUPPLIES THISSPRING, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MOUNTED A MASSIVE " LEARN FROM LEI FENG "PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN, IN AN EFFORT TO HALT WHAT IDEOLOGISTS CALL THEPEASANTS' " SPONTANEOUS TENDENCY TOWARD CAPITALISM . " TO THE DISMAY OFENTERPRISING PEASANTS, THE GOVERNMENT STARTED CUTTING DOWN ON THEMINUTE PRIVATE PLOTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO CULTIVATE AND TOUSE AS A SOURCE OF INDEPENDENT INCOME . IT SEEMED ILLOGICAL, SINCE ITWAS THE INCENTIVE THAT HELPED BOOST FARM PRODUCTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. NEVERTHELESS, IN KIANGSI PROVINCE, RADIO NANCHANG EXHORTS DAILY : "THE COLLECTIVE MUST COME BEFORE PRIVATE PLOTS . " AT A COMMUNE INKWANGTUNG PROVINCE, WHERE PEASANTS USED TO HAVE TO SUPPLY THECOLLECTIVE WITH 33 LBS . OF HUMAN ORDURE A MONTH, THEIR QUOTA HAS BEENBOOSTED TO 55 LBS., THUS LIMITING THE ONLY FERTILIZER AVAILABLE FORFREELANCE FARMING . AS AN ADDED TURN OF THE SCREW, PRODUCTION QUOTASFOR COLLECTIVE OUTPUT HAVE BEEN SHARPLY INCREASED, IN HOPES THAT THEPEASANTS WILL HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME WORKING FOR MAO TSE-TUNG AND LESSFOR TSU-FA, MEANING " SELF-PROSPERITY . " THE GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN MAYWELL FIZZLE, AS IT DID IN 1958 . SAYS ONE EXPERT ON CHINA'S AGRICULTURE: " IN THE DEBRIS OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD, COMPULSION CANNOT WORK .ALL THAT IS LEFT IS PERSUASION . " MOST PEASANTS ARE CONVINCEDNONETHELESS THAT THEY ARE IN FOR A FAR MORE RIGOROUS EXISTENCE ; MANYEACH WEEK ARE STILL FLEEING THE MAINLAND . IN MACAO, WHERE HE SOUGHTREFUGE AFTER SWIMMING SIX HOURS ACROSS THE PEARL RIVER DELTA, AHANDSOME, HUSKYLOOKING YOUTH FROM KWANGTUNG PROVINCE SHRUGGED LAST WEEK: " WHAT CAN YOU DO ? HOW CAN YOU MOVE ? IT'S LIKE A HEAVY STONECRUSHING YOU . /
