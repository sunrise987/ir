GREECE THE KING WANTS TO TRAVEL THE KING WAS WORKING IN THEGARDEN . HE SEEMED VERY GLAD TO SEE ME . WE WALKED THROUGH THE GARDEN .THIS IS THE QUEEN, HE SAID . SHE WAS CLIPPING A ROSE BUSH . OH HOW DOYOU DO, SHE SAID . WE SAT DOWN AT A TABLE UNDER A BIG TREE AND THE KINGORDERED WHISKEY AND SODA . WE HAVE GOOD WHISKEY ANYWAY, HE SAID . . . ITWAS VERY JOLLY . WE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME . LIKE ALL GREEKS HE WANTEDTO GO TO AMERICA . THUS, IN JUST ABOUT THE SHORTEST STORY HE EVERWROTE, ERNEST HEMINGWAY 40 YEARS AGO DESCRIBED KING CONSTANTINE ANDQUEEN SOPHIA AS THEY WERE CLINGING TO THE UNSTABLE THRONE OF GREECE .LAST WEEK CONSTANTINE'S SON, KING PAUL, WAS ALSO IN HIS GARDENED PALACEAT TATOI, OUTSIDE ATHENS, AND THE WHISKEY WAS STILL GOOD . BUT UNLIKEHIS FATHER, PAUL DID NOT WANT TO GO TO AMERICA . HE WANTED TO GO TOBRITAIN, AND HIS PREMIER WOULD NOT LET HIM, THEREBY PRECIPITATING AFIRST-CLASS POLITICAL CRISIS . PRIVATE REFUGE . THE PETTY-SEEMING ISSUEOF THE TRIP IS ACTUALLY PART OF A WIDER, MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM . PREMIERCONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS, 56, IS A TOUGH, STAUNCHLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,PRO-NATO POLITICIAN WHO IN HIS EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE (THE LONGESTTENURE FOR ANY GREEK PRIME MINISTER) HAS GIVEN HIS COUNTRY STABLEGOVERNMENT AND A CONSIDERABLE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS . BUTLEFTISTS AND LIBERALS ATTACK HIM FOR ALLEGEDLY HAVING RIGGED THE 1961ELECTIONS, WHICH RETURNED HIM TO POWER FOR A FOURTH TERM, AND FORKEEPING ABOUT 1,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS JAILED WHO WERE ARRESTED MORETHAN 15 YEARS AGO DURING THE COUNTRY'S BITTER AND VICTORIOUS WAR WITHRED INSURGENTS . COMMUNISTS AND WELL-MEANING LIBERALS OUTSIDE GREECE,PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN, THIS YEAR STARTED A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN AGAINSTTHE KARAMANLIS REGIME, AND AGAINST THE ROYAL FAMILY NOTABLY QUEENFREDERIKA, WHO WAS ACCUSED OF NAZI CONNECTIONS . BERTRAND RUSSELL'SBAN-THE-BOMBERS JOINED THE FRAY, AND LAST APRIL, WHEN FREDERIKA WAS INLONDON FOR THE WEDDING OF HER THIRD COUSIN PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, SHE WASSET UPON BY A CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AND FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE IN APRIVATE HOUSE . BRITAIN'S ANTI-GREEK CHORUS WAS SWELLED BY LORDBEAVERBROOK, WHO, FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN, SCURRILOUSLY ATTACKED HER INHIS NEWSPAPERS FOR HER GERMAN BACKGROUND . WITH ALL THIS IN MIND,KARAMANLIS ADVISED THE KING BELATEDLY AGAINST A PLANNED STATE VISIT TOBRITAIN IN JULY . THERE MIGHT BE SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING THE TRIP, HESAID, AND THE GREEK RIGHTISTS, RESENTING LEFT-WING ATTACKS ABROAD,MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE, TOO, AS THEY DID IN SALONIKA RECENTLY, WHERE ALEFT-WING MEMBER OF THE GREEK PARLIAMENT WAS KILLED . THE KING'SPLAINTIVE REJOINDER WAS THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION LONG AGOAND IT WOULD BE UNGENTLEMANLY TO BACK OUT NOW . THE BRITISH HADPROMISED ADEQUATE SECURITY . BESIDES, HE DID NOT WANT TO APPEAR TO GIVEIN TO PRESSURE FROM THE LEFT . KING PAUL WAS REINFORCED BY PERT QUEENFREDERIKA WHO, LIKE HER GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER QUEEN VICTORIA,STRONGLY FEELS THAT SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN HER MINISTERS WHAT IS GOODFOR HER COUNTRY . EMBARRASSING REDS . REBUFFED, KARAMANLIS HANDED INHIS RESIGNATION . USUALLY KNOWN AS LOYAL TO THE KING, HE WASNEVERTHELESS TRYING TO PUT THE ROYAL FAMILY IN ITS PLACE, BECAUSE OFWIDESPREAD FEELING IN GREECE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A SOMEWHAT-TOO-ACTIVEPART IN POLITICS OF LATE . AT THE SAME TIME, KARAMANLIS WAS TRYING TOBRING ABOUT NEW ELECTIONS, CONFIDENT THAT HIS NATIONAL RADICAL UNION,WHICH HOLDS 180 OF 300 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, WOULD BE VICTORIOUS .INSTEAD OF CALLING ELECTIONS, HOWEVER, KING PAUL AT WEEK'S END WASATTEMPTING TO PATCH UP A COALITION OF PRESENT PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT THE20 COMMUNIST MEMBERS, OUT OF DISLIKE OF KARAMANLIS, ARE EMBARRASSINGLYBEHIND THE KING . BUT THE ATTEMPT IS DOOMED TO FAILURE UNLESS SOME OFKARAMANLIS' DEPUTIES JOIN THE COALITION . KARAMANLIS SEEMED UNDISTURBEDBY THE ROYAL MANEUVERING . " THEY ARE TRYING TO BREAK UP MY PARTY, " HESAID SCORNFULLY . SNAPPING ONE FINGER ACROSS HIS PALM, HE ADDED : /BUT I HAVE GOT MY PARTY LIKE THAT . " MEANWHILE, WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT,THE KING AND QUEEN QUITE LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO STAY INTHEIR GARDEN AT TATOI OR START PACKING FOR THEIR TRIP . UNDER THE GREEKCONSTITUTION, THE MONARCH CANNOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT THE CONSENTOF HIS GOVERNMENT .
