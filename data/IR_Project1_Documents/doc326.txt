SOUTH VIET NAM THE CRACKDOWN OVER ANDOVER, THE DESPERATE VOICE SHOUTED INTO THE TELEPHONE : " THEY AREBREAKING INTO XA LOI PAGODA . THEY ARE BREAKING INTO XA LOI PAGODA . "IN THE BACKGROUND, GUNFIRE MINGLED WITH THE CONFUSED SCREAMS OFBUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS AND THE CLANGING ALARM OF THE HUGE BRASS GONGTHAT HANGS IN THE BELL TOWER OF SAIGON'S LARGEST PAGODA . SUDDENLY THEPHONE CONNECTION FROM THE TEMPLE WENT DEAD . IT WAS 12 : 20 A.M .USING THEIR RIFLE BUTTS AS CLUBS, SQUADS OF TOUGH, RIOTTRAINED "SPECIAL FORCES " SMASHED INTO THE PAGODA, BATTERING A PATH THROUGH ASMALL GUARD OF YOUNG BUDDHIST MONKS . THE TROOPERS HAD A LIST, AND EACHMONK ON THE LIST WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A " COMMUNIST IN DISGUISE . " ONTHE TEMPLE'S SECOND FLOOR, ONE MONK TRIED TO RESIST AND WAS THROWNBODILY FROM A BALCONY TO THE COURT-YARD 20 FT . BELOW . OTHER MONKS ANDNUNS WERE ROUTED FROM BEHIND A FLIMSY BARRICADE OF WOODEN BENCHES ANDFORCED OUTSIDE BY TEAR GAS AND GUNSHOTS . SACKING THE PAGODA'S MAINALTAR, THE RAIDERS CARTED AWAY THE CHARRED HEART OF BUDDHIST MARTYRTHICH QUANG DUC, WHO LAST JUNE WAS THE FIRST OF FIVE BUDDHISTS TO BURNHIMSELF TO DEATH IN PROTEST AGAINST THE DIEM GOVERNMENT'S ANTIBUDDHISTDRIVE . BUT THE BUDDHISTS MANAGED TO SPIRIT OUT OF THE BUILDING THERECEPTACLE HOLDING QUANG DUC'S ASHES . " THE ASHES ARE HOLY, " SAID ONEMONK . " WE WOULD GIVE 15 LIVES TO DEFEND THEM . " TWO OTHER MONKSESCAPED OVER THE BACK WALL OF XA LOI (PRONOUNCED SAH LOY) INTO THEGROUNDS OF THE ADJOINING U.S . AID MISSION, WHERE THEY WERE GIVENTEMPORARY SANCTUARY . TO THE DIEM GOVERNMENT, THE CRACKDOWN OBVIOUSLYSEEMED NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE REGIME AND ENFORCE THE LAW OF THE LANDAGAINST BUDDHIST DEFIANCE . BUT IT WAS BRUTAL, NONETHELESS, AND ITAROUSED A STRONG NEW WAVE OF SYMPATHY FOR THE BUDDHISTS . IT ALSO PUTU.S . POLICY IN SOUTH VIET NAM, WHICH INVOLVES THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF14,000 U.S . TROOPS, INTO AN AGONIZING DILEMMA . WHILE OFTEN UNHAPPYWITH DIEM, THE U.S . HAS PROCEEDED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS SAFERTO STICK WITH HIM THAN RISK THE CHAOS THAT MIGHT SURROUND A SWITCH TO ANEW, UNKNOWN AND UNPREDICTABLE REGIME . BUT BY HIS MOVE AGAINST THEBUDDHIST MONKS, WHO HAVE THE GROWING SUPPORT OF THE COUNTRY'S VASTBUDDHIST MAJORITY, ROMAN CATHOLIC DIEM MAY FINALLY HAVE SHATTERED HISOWN POLITICAL USEFULNESS . HE ALSO OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITIES OFCOUPS, COUNTER-COUPS, AND EVEN CIVIL WAR FROM ALL OF WHICH ONLY THECOMMUNIST VIET CONG COULD BENEFIT . BOOLA, BOOLA . UNTIL LAST WEEK,PRODDED BY THE U.S., DIEM HAD DISPLAYED AN APPARENT WILLINGNESS TOCONCILIATE THE BUDDHISTS . FEELING BETRAYED BY DIEM'S CRACKDOWN, ONERANKING U.S . EMBASSY OFFICER SAID : " ALL THE TIME THEY'VE BEENPREACHING CONCILIATION TO US, THEY'VE EVIDENTLY BEEN PLANNING JUST THEOPPOSITE . " THE BUDDHIST CRISIS HAD BEGUN AS A RELIGIOUS ONE, BUTGRADUALLY TURNED INTO A MAJOR POLITICAL CONFLICT . THE BUDDHISTS AREFAR FROM PASSIVE MARTYRS . THEIR RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL DEMANDS A FAIRLYMODEST PACKAGE DEMANDING FULL EQUALITY WITH THE COUNTRY'S ROMANCATHOLICS HAD NEVER SOUNDED CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY SINCE EVEN DIEM'S WORSTENEMIES COULD NOT POINT TO ANY REAL ANTI-BUDDHIST DISCRIMINATION ORPERSECUTION . BUT WHEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS STUPIDLY KILLED 13 BUDDHISTSIN A DEMONSTRATION IN HUE (PRONOUNCED WHEY) FOUR MONTHS AGO, THEBUDDHISTS MADE THE CLEARLY POLITICAL DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPT/ RESPONSIBILITY " FOR THE INCIDENT . SINCE THEN, THE BUDDHISTS HAVEDEVELOPED INTO A SERIOUS OPPOSITION MOVEMENT . PAGODAS, SPORTINGPROTEST SIGNS IN VIETNAMESE AND ENGLISH, BECAME COMMAND POSTS WHEREDUPLICATING MACHINES GROUND OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES, ANDTHE SOUND OF TYPEWRITERS AND TELEPHONES BLENDED WITH THE BOOM OF TEMPLEGONGS . APPEALS FOR AID WERE BROADCAST TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POPE PAULVI, AND U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT . AT A GRISLY, WELL-ORGANIZEDPRESS CONFERENCE IN SAIGON, BUDDHIST LEADERS INTRODUCED A TINY,WITHERED BUDDHIST NUN AS A CANDIDATE FOR SELF-IMMOLATION IN PROTESTAGAINST THE DIEM GOVERNMENT . WHEN ONE BUDDHIST SPOKESMAN WHO HADSTUDIED AT YALE WANTED TO PASS OUT THE LATEST COMMUNIQUES FROM THEPAGODA, HE WOULD STROLL UP TO A YALE-EDUCATED U.S . NEWSMAN AND SAY :/ BOOLA, BOOLA . /IN THE EARLY PHASES OF THE QUARREL, DIEMPROBABLY COULD AND SHOULD HAVE CONCILIATED THE BUDDHISTS . BUT HEVACILLATED . HIS BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW, NGO DINH NHU AND MME . NHU,INSISTED THAT UNLESS THE BUDDHISTS WERE CRUSHED, THERE WOULD BE A COUPTHREATENING THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE FAMILY'S RULE . MME . NHU'S FIERYPHILIPPICS LENT IMPETUS TO THE BUDDHIST MOVEMENT JUST AS IT APPEARED TOBE FLAGGING . BY LAST WEEK, AFTER THREE BUDDHIST SUICIDES SPURRED NEWPROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, IT WAS CLEARLY TOO LATEFOR CONCILIATION . EVEN IF DIEM HAD WANTED IT, THE BUDDHIST LEADERSTHEMSELVES NO LONGER WANTED IT ; THEY WERE PLAINLY DETERMINED TO PRESSTHEIR ADVANTAGE . AND SO THE GOVERNMENT EVIDENTLY YIELDED TO NHU'SGET-TOUGH POLICY . ROPE TRICK . THE CRACKDOWN IN SAIGON WAS DUPLICATEDALL OVER SOUTH VIET NAM, AND MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE WERE IMPRISONED .IN THE BUDDHIST STRONGHOLD OF HUE, THE APPROACH OF GOVERNMENT TROOPSWAS SIGNALED BY THE BEATING OF TEMPLE DRUMS AND THE CLASHING OF CYMBALSCALLING FOR HELP . BEATING POTS AND PANS TO ROUSE THEIR NEIGHBORS, THEANGRY POPULACE POURED FROM HOMES AND RACED TO DEFEND THE CITY'S TEMPLES. AT TU DAM PAGODA, MONKS TRIED TO TURN THE COFFIN OF A PRIEST WHO HADBURNED HIMSELF ALIVE IN THE BUDDHIST SUICIDE PROTEST WAVE . BUTGOVERNMENT SOLDIERS, FIRING M1 RIFLES AS THEY ADVANCED, OVERRAN THETEMPLE, SNATCHED THE SMOLDERING COFFIN AWAY, AND SMASHED A STATUE OFGAUTAMA BUDDHA . FROM THE TEMPLE'S TREASURY THEY TOOK AN ESTIMATED$30,000 AND LEFT THE PAGODA A GUTTED RUIN . NEAR HUE'S DIEU DE PAGODA,THE GOVERNMENT FORCES MET THEIR FIRST DETERMINED RESISTANCE . AS TROOPSTRIED TO STRETCH A BARBED-WIRE BARRICADE ACROSS THE BRIDGE LEADING TOTHE TEMPLE, A MOB TORE IT DOWN WITH BARE HANDS . WITH FISTS, ROCKS ANDSHARPENED STICKS, THE CROWD FOUGHT THE HEAVILY ARMED TROOPS FOR THEBRIDGE . TEAR-GAS GRENADES THROWN BY THE SOLDIERS WERE CAUGHT ANDTHROWN RIGHT BACK AT THEM . WHEN TROOPS TRIED TO CLEAR A WAY THROUGHTHE BRIDGE DEFENDERS WITH THEIR RIFLE BUTTS, THE CROWD TORE THE WEAPONSFROM THEIR HANDS AND JABBED THE SOLDIERS IN THE GROIN . AFTER AFIVE-HOUR PITCHED BATTLE, THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY WON CONTROL OF THEBRIDGE AT DAYBREAK BY DRIVING ARMORED CARS THROUGH THE SCREAMING,SPITTING, SWEARING MOB . THE DEFENSE OF THE BRIDGE AND THE TEMPLE COSTTHE TOWNSPEOPLE AN ESTIMATED 30 DEAD AND 200 WOUNDED . TEN TRUCKLOADSOF BRIDGE DEFENDERS WERE CARTED AWAY TO JAIL, MANY STREAMING BLOOD, ANDAN ESTIMATED 500 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED THROUGHOUT THE CITY, INCLUDING 17OF THE 47 HUE UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS WHO HAD RESIGNED EARLIER IN THEWEEK IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FIRING OF THE SCHOOL'S RECTOR, A CATHOLICPRIEST AND AN OPPONENT OF DIEM'S BROTHER, ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH THUC .THOUGH A 24-HOUR CURFEW WAS CLAMPED ON HUE, THE CITY'S RESIDENTS WERESTILL DEFIANT . ONE BUDDHIST MONK FLED THROUGH THE STREETS HOTLYPURSUED BY THREE GOVERNMENT TROOPERS . THE PRIEST RACED DOWN AN ALLEYAT WHOSE ENTRANCE SAT AN AGED VIETNAMESE WOMAN . AS THE SOLDIERS TURNEDINTO THE ALLEY, THE WOMAN PULLED TIGHTLY ON A ROPE STRETCHED ACROSS THESTREET, BRINGING ALL THREE SOLDIERS TUMBLING DOWN . THEN SHE SCUTTLEDAWAY TO SAFETY . ARTICLE 44 . AT 6 A.M., RADIO SAIGON CRACKLED TO LIFEAND PRESIDENT DIEM CAME ON THE AIR . " UNDER ARTICLE 44 OF THECONSTITUTION, " HE SAID, " I DECLARE A STATE OF SIEGE THROUGHOUT THENATIONAL TERRITORY . I CONFER UPON THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAMTHE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESTORE SECURITY AND PUBLIC ORDER SO THAT THESTATE MAY BE PROTECTED, COMMUNISM DEFEATED, FREEDOM SECURED, ANDDEMOCRACY ACHIEVED . " UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION, THE ARMY WASGIVEN BLANKET SEARCH-AND-ARREST POWERS AND EMPOWERED TO FORBID ALLPUBLIC GATHERINGS, RESTRICT PRESS FREEDOM, AND PROHIBIT THE CIRCULATIONOF ALL " PRINTED MATERIAL AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HARMFUL TO PUBLIC ORDERAND SECURITY . " IN SAIGON THE ARMY IMPOSED A TIGHT 9 P.M.-TO-5 A.M .CURFEW . CARRYING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND RIFLES WITH FIXED BAYONETS,TROOPS IN FULL CAMOUFLAGE BATTLE DRESS GUARDED EVERY MAJOR BRIDGE ANDINTERSECTION . TIGHT CENSORSHIP WAS CLAMPED ON ALL OUTGOING NEWS, ANDREPORTERS WERE FORCED TO GIVE THEIR STORIES TO TRAVELERS FLYING TONEIGHBORING COUNTRIES OR TO FLY OUT THEMSELVES WITH THEIR COPY .TELEPHONE SERVICE IN THE HOMES AND OFFICES OF ALL U.S . MILITARY ANDEMBASSY PERSONNEL WAS CUT OFF .THE POLITICALREPERCUSSIONS BEGAN AT ONCE . PROTESTING THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION,FOREIGN MINISTER VU VAN MAU QUIT HIS POST, SHAVED HIS HEAD ANDANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD GO TO INDIA TO BECOME A CONTEMPLATIVE BUDDHISTMONK . SOUTH VIET NAM'S AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON, TRAN VAN CHUONG, WHOIS MME . NHU'S FATHER, ALSO QUIT, WITH A SHARP DENUNCIATION OF HISDAUGHTER'S POLICIES AND OF THE DIEM GOVERNMENT FOR " COPYING THETACTICS OF TOTALITARIAN REGIMES . " AS LONG AS DIEM STAYS IN POWER, HEADDED, THERE IS " NOT ONE CHANCE OF WINNING THE WAR AGAINST THECOMMUNISTS .IN SAIGON MORE THAN 500UNIVERSITY OF SAIGON MEDICAL STUDENTS BOYCOTTED CLASSES AND HELDTURBULENT ANTI-GOVERNMENT MEETINGS . WHEN A PROFESSOR TRIED TO RIP DOWNA PRO-BUDDHIST POSTER, HE WAS STONED BY STUDENTS . THROUGHOUT THE CITY,MARTIAL LAW POSTERS WERE SURREPTITIOUSLY DEFACED OR TORN AWAY .STUDENTS JEERED AT SOLDIERS PATROLLING THE STREETS : " WHY DON'T YOUGO BACK TO FIGHTING THE VIET CONG ? " THE GOVERNMENT RETALIATEDAGAINST STUDENT UNREST BY CLOSING ALL SAIGON'S SCHOOLS . THE UGLYAMERICAN . THE CRACKDOWN IN SOUTH VIET NAM CAUSED CONSTERNATION INWASHINGTON . IN A BLUNT CONDEMNATION THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THATSAIGON'S STRONG-ARM TACTICS REPRESENTED " A DIRECT VIOLATION BY THEVIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT OF ASSURANCES THAT IT WAS PURSUING A POLICY OFRECONCILIATION TOWARD THE BUDDHISTS . THE U.S . DEPLORES REPRESSIVEACTIONS OF THIS NATURE . " THE MOVE AGAINST THE BUDDHISTS WAS OBVIOUSLYTIMED TO BE OVER AND DONE WITH BEFORE U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOTLODGE ARRIVED IN SAIGON . WHEN IT HAPPENED, LODGE WAS IN JAPAN . ON THEWAY OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO BY COMMERCIAL JET, HE HAD FOUND HIMSELFACROSS THE AISLE FROM NOVELIST EUGENE BURDICK, CO-AUTHOR OF THE UGLYAMERICAN, AND THAT SELF-APPOINTED EXPERT ON U.S . ERRORS IN THE FAREAST OFFERED THE AMBASSADOR A HALF-HOUR BRIEFING, TO WHICH LODGELISTENED DIPLOMATICALLY . THE GIST : DON'T RELY ON EMBASSY OFFICERS,CONSULT SEASONED NEWSMEN, BEWARE OF COMMUNICATIONS BLOCKS IN THEEMBASSY, GET FIGHTER COVER FOR THOSE COMBAT HELICOPTERS . ON ORDERSFROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, LODGE CUT SHORT HIS STAY IN JAPAN, AND BYHASTILY COMMANDEERED U.S . AIR FORCE DC-6 PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO SAIGON,WHERE HE WAS MET BY A VIETNAMESE PROTOCOL OFFICER, EMBASSY OFFICIALSAND GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, COMMANDER OF THE U.S . TROOPS IN SOUTH VIETNAM . AS IF TO DRAMATIZE U.S . DISAPPROVAL OF THE GOVERNMENT ACTION,LODGE WENT TO THE U.S . AID MISSION BUILDING TO TALK TO THE TWO MONKSWHO HAD BEEN GIVEN SANCTUARY . IGNORING DEMANDS THAT THE MONKS BETURNED OVER TO VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES, LODGE ORDERED THE U.S . STAFF TOGET SOME VEGETABLES FOR THE VEGETARIAN PRIESTS . ANTI, ANTI, ANTI .WHAT TO DO NEXT WAS A QUESTION THICKLY CLOUDED FOR BOTH LODGE ANDWASHINGTON BY CONFUSION OVER PRECISELY WHO WAS IN CONTROL OF THESITUATION IN SOUTH VIET NAM . DIEM STILL SEEMED IN COMPLETE CHARGE ANDIN A CABLE TO THE NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE'S MARGUERITE HIGGINS HEDECLARED, " I TRUST IN THE ARMY AND IN FACT I MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THESITUATION . " BUT IT LOOKED INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT THE KEY FIGUREBEHIND THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVE HAD BEEN BROTHER NHU, HEAD OF THE10,000-STRONG SPECIAL FORCES AND SECRET POLICE . FOR WEEKS THERE HADBEEN HINTS THAT HE MIGHT TRY A COUP OF HIS OWN SUPPOSEDLY TO FORESTALLTHE ANTI-DIEM COUP THAT HE KEPT PREDICTING UNLESS THE BUDDHISTS WERE PUTDOWN . ANY CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY, HE HAD WARNED, WOULD BE "ANTI-BUDDHIST, ANTI-AMERICAN, ANTI-WEAKNESS . /THE CRACKDOWN IT WAS NHU'SSPECIAL FORCES THAT SACKED THE PAGODAS ; REGULAR ARMY TROOPS WERE ONLYCALLED IN AFTER THE JOB WAS DONE TO HELP KEEP ORDER . THEORETICALLY,UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION, IT IS NOW THE ARMY THAT RUNS THECOUNTRY, AND, AGAIN THEORETICALLY, DIEM PLACED TOP AUTHORITY IN MAJORGENERAL TRAN VAN DON, 46, A HIGHLY RESPECTED, ONETIME CORPS COMMANDERWHO HAS HAD GREAT MILITARY SUCCESS AGAINST THE VIET CONG . BUT DON MAYMERELY BE A FIGUREHEAD HOSTILE TO THE GOVERNMENT, HE WAS PULLED OUT OFHIS FIELD COMMAND LAST DECEMBER AND KICKED UPSTAIRS TO A STAFF JOB,WHERE HE WOULD HAVE NO TROOPS AT HIS DISPOSAL IN CASE THE THOUGHT OF ACOUP EVER CROSSED HIS MIND . DIEM AND NHU EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO VESTREAL MILITARY POWER IN ANOTHER, VERY DIFFERENT OFFICER, WHOSE LOYALTYTHE NGO FAMILY CAN COUNT ON, COLONEL LE QUANT TUNG, COMMANDER UNDER NHUOF THE SPECIAL FORCES . A DEVOUT CATHOLIC, TUNG COMES FROM CENTRAL VIETNAM, BIRTHPLACE OF THE NGO FAMILY, APPARENTLY HAS NO POLITICALAMBITIONS, AND WAS ONCE A TOP OFFICIAL IN NHU'S SECRET ORGANIZATION,THE CAN LAO PARTY . AS LONG AS A MONTH AGO, LARGE UNITS OF SPECIALFORCES WERE MOVED INTO SAIGON UNDER COLONEL TUNG'S COMMAND . THE BIGQUESTION IS WHETHER TUNG CAN KEEP CONTROL AND WHETHER THE REGULAR ARMYWILL GO ALONG OR WILL TURN AGAINST THE REGIME . THE COURSE OF EVENTS .AFTER NINE YEARS OF ABSOLUTE POWER, THE NGO FAMILY HAD TAKEN ACONSIDERABLE RISK IN LETTING SO MUCH AUTHORITY SLIP FROM ITS HANDSUNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION . TAKING OVER THE FUNCTIONING OF ALLGOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ARMY FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS A VIABLE POWERSTRUCTURE OF ITS OWN . IT MAY WELL STAY LOYAL AS LONG AS DIEM REMAINSIN THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, BUT NHU IS VASTLY UNPOPULAR WITH MOST OFTHE MILITARY COMMANDERS EXCEPT TUNG . THE ARMY IMMEDIATELY TRIED TODISSOCIATE ITSELF FROM THE BUDDHIST CRACKDOWN . ALL OFFICIAL BULLETINSFROM THE ARMY-CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT INFORMATION CENTER POINTEDLYMENTIONED THAT NHU'S SPECIAL FORCES, AND NOT THE ARMY, HAD WRECKED THEPAGODAS . BUT HAVING DISCOVERED THAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR POWER NOWEXISTS OUTSIDE THE NGO FAMILY, VARIOUS MILITARY FACTIONS MAY WELL BEGINTO JOCKEY FOR SOLE AUTHORITY . AT WEEK'S END, ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,THIS FEAR WAS REALIZED AT THE SMALL TOWN OF MY THO, JUST SOUTH OFSAIGON, WHERE BUDDHIST AND CATHOLIC TROOPS TURNED ON EACH OTHER . INTHE FIELD, ACTION AGAINST THE VIET CONG HAS COME TO A VIRTUALSTANDSTILL . " THIS WRECKS THE ARMY'S EFFORTS AGAINST THE REDS, " SAIDA SENIOR U.S . INTELLIGENCE OFFICER . " THEY'RE TOO BUSY ENFORCINGCURFEWS TO FIGHT . HOW THE REDS MUST BE LOVING THIS . " MORE THAN EVER,DIEM'S GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER IN SOUTH VIET NAM DEPENDS ON U.S .BACKING . YET EVEN IF WASHINGTON SHOULD OFFICIALLY DECIDE THAT DIEM HASBECOME A LIABILITY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE VIET CONG, THE U.S . WILLNOT SUPPORT A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT WHILE THE POWERS IN SAIGON ARE STILLSETTLING ACCOUNTS AMONG THEMSELVES . SAID ONE WASHINGTON OFFICIAL : "WHEN THE RUMBLING OF OPPOSITION STARTS WITHIN A REGIME OF THIS SORT,YOU CAN'T  TELL WHERE EVENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT . /
