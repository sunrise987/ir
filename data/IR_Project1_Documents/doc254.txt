THE ALLIES THREE ON A HORSE TOP BRITISH DEFENSE OFFICIALSLISTENED POLITELY IN LONDON LAST WEEK WHILE A U.S . NAVY TASK FORCEARGUED THE MERITS OF A MISSILE-FIRING SURFACE FLEET MANNED BY MIXEDNATO CREWS . THE BRITONS' REAL FEELINGS TOWARD THE MULTILATERAL FORCE(MLF) WERE BEST EXPRESSED IN A SARDONIC LIMERICK THAT MADE THE ROUNDSOF WHITEHALL : HOORAY FOR THE MULTIMIXED FORCE, GERMAN, BRITISH ANDYANKEE, OF COURSE ! EACH PRODUCES A KNIGHT, AND THE PLAN IS TO FIGHTOR DETER WITH ALL THREE ON ONE HORSE . BEHIND U.S . EFFORTS TO SELL MLFWAS THE ILL-CONCEALED FACT THAT MILITARY WASHINGTON DOES NOT REALLYBELIEVE IN IT EITHER . PRIVATELY THE PENTAGON CONSIDERS IT AT BEST AGIMMICK TO POSTPONE " PROLIFERATION " OF INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR FORCES TOOTHER NATIONS, WHICH IT WANTS AT ALL COSTS TO PREVENT OR DELAY . "MONSTROUS NONSENSE . " CHARGED WITH THE HALFHEARTED MISSION OF WINNINGBRITISH SUPPORT FOR THE $5 BILLION MLF WAS ADMIRAL CLAUDE RICKETTS, U.S. DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, WHO HAS DOUBLED OF LATE AS THEPENTAGON'S MULTIMIXMASTER . STRATEGICALLY, HE ARGUED, A FORCE OF 25POLARIS VESSELS CRUISING EUROPE'S SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS COULD NOTEASILY BE DESTROYED BY SOVIET SUBMARINES OR AIRCRAFT . SAID RICKETTS :/ EACH ADDITIONAL WEAPONS SYSTEM ENHANCES THE CREDIBILITY OF OTHERSYSTEMS " BUT R.A.F . MARSHAL SIR JOHN SLESSOR CALLED IT " MONSTROUSMILITARY NONSENSE, " AND MANY OTHER BRITISH DEFENSE OFFICIALS AGREED .THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S MAIN JUSTIFICATION FOR MLF IS NOT MILITARY BUTPOLITICAL . IT IS AIMED PRIMARILY AT SATISFYING WEST GERMANY'S DEMANDFOR AN EQUAL VOICE WITH BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN NATO'S NUCLEAR COUNCILS,AND THE GERMANS ARE ALREADY PLEDGED TO MATCH THE U.S.'S OFFER TOSHOULDER 40 PER CENT OF THE COST . WITHOUT BRITISH BACKING, HOWEVER,MLF WILL NEVER GET OFF THE DRAWING BOARD ; THE U.S . IS NOT WILLING TOSHARE THE FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH GERMANY ALONE .BUT THE BRITISH, WHO ARE ALREADY COMMITTED TO BUILDING A $1 BILLIONPOLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET BY 1970, REPLY THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO POURMORE MONEY INTO ANYTHING AS THEORETICAL AS MLF . EUROPE'S MOST TELLINGOBJECTION TO THE PROJECT IS THAT EVEN IF THE ALLIES DID CHIP IN,ULTIMATE CONTROL OF ITS WEAPONS WOULD STILL REST WITH THE U.S . WHONEEDS IT ? THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION HOPES NONETHELESS TO WINBRITISH AS WELL AS GERMAN SUPPORT FOR THE FORCE . " WE CERTAINLY DON'TNEED IT, " EXPLAINED A HIGH-RANKING ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL LAST WEEK,/ NOR DO THE EUROPEANS . BUT IF IT SATISFIES THEM, I THINK IT IS WORTHPURSUING . IF IT DOESN'T, WELL, AT LEAST WE MADE THE OFFER . " ALL THISMERELY OBSCURED WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE REAL U.S . POLICY AN INDEPENDENTNUCLEAR FORCE FOR A TRULY UNITED EUROPE ; 2) FULL U.S . RESPONSIBILITYFOR THE DEFENSE OF EUROPE UNTIL THAT GOAL IS ACHIEVED .
