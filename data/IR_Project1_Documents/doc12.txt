SOUTH VIET NAM THE HELICOPTER WAR RUNS INTO TROUBLE THEHELICOPTER HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE UGLY LITTLE ANTI-COMMUNIST WAR INSOUTH VIET NAM . USING THE WHIRLYBIRDS FOR TRANSPORT, GOVERNMENT FORCESNO LONGER REMAIN IMMOBILE IN FIXED OUTPOSTS . THEY NOW GO WHERE THEVIET CONG GOES . SOMETIMES THIS IS NOT VERY HEALTHY, FOR THE REDGUERRILLAS HAVE DEVELOPED TACTICS TO COUNTER THE COPTERS . IN THE EARLYDAYS, THEY TRIED TO SHOOT THEM DOWN WITH HOMEMADE SHOTGUNS AND ANCIENTFRENCH RIFLES ; ONE HELICOPTER EVEN RETURNED TO BASE WITH AN ARROWSTUCK IN ITS FUSELAGE . TODAY, WITH MORE PRACTICE AND AN ABUNDANTSUPPLY OF CAPTURED U.S . WEAPONS, THE VIET CONG GANGMEN CAN MAKE THINGSHOT FOR THE MOST SKILLED U.S . HELICOPTER PILOT . LAST WEEK THE VIETCONG FORCES PROVED THEIR PROWESS BY SHOOTING DOWN FIVE HELICOPTERS OVERRICE MARSHES SOUTHWEST OF SAIGON AND INFLICTING A BRUTAL DEFEAT ON THEGOVERNMENT FORCES . LIKE SHOOTING DUCKS . THE BATTLE BEGAN AS A ROUTINE/ SEARCH AND CLEAR " OPERATION IN A RED-INFESTED AREA NEAR THE TINYHAMLET OF APBAC . THE STRIKE PLAN CALLED FOR TEN U.S . H-21TROOP-CARRYING HELICOPTERS, ESCORTED BY FIVE U.S . ROCKET-FIRING HU-1ACHOPPERS, TO FERRY 400 GOVERNMENT TROOPS TO THE DROP ZONE IN WAVES OF100 MEN EACH . THE FIRST THREE GROUPS LANDED WITH NO GROUND FIRE FROMTHE ENEMY . BUT AS THE FOURTH LIFT FLUTTERED OVER THE PADDIES, THECOMMUNISTS LET LOOSE WITH A BLAZE OF BULLETS FROM THE WOODS AT THE EDGEOF THE RICE FIELD . " THE TREE LINE SEEMED TO EXPLODE WITH MACHINE-GUNFIRE, " SAID ONE HELICOPTER PILOT . " IT WAS PURE HELL . " VIRTUALLYMOTIONLESS, THE BANANA-SHAPED HELICOPTERS WERE HELPLESS TARGETS ATPOINT-BLANK RANGE ; FIVE OF THE HOVERING CHOPPERS WERE SHOT DOWN, ANDNINE OTHERS WERE RIDDLED BY ENEMY FIRE . ON THE GROUND, THE GOVERNMENTFORCES WERE PINNED DOWN IN THE HAIL OF FIRE . " WHEN THOSE POORVIETNAMESE CAME OUT OF THE CHOPPERS, IT WAS LIKE SHOOTING DUCKS FOR THEVIET CONG, " SAID ONE U.S . OFFICER . THE STUNNED SURVIVORS BURROWEDINTO THE SLIMY MUD OF THE PADDIES AND STAYED THERE, REFUSING TOCONTINUE THE ASSAULT . DESPERATELY CAPTAIN KENNETH GOOD, 32, A WESTPOINTER FROM EWA BEACH, HAWAII, SOUGHT TO RALLY THE VIETNAMESE FOR ACOUNTERATTACK, BUT HE WAS STITCHED THROUGH THE NECK AND CHEST BY ABURST FROM A VIET CONG AUTOMATIC RIFLE . THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS STAYEDPUT . AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF CONTINUOUS BOMBARDMENT, REINFORCEMENTS BEGANTO ARRIVE . BLASTING AWAY WITH MACHINE GUNS, GOVERNMENT ARMORED CARSREPEATEDLY ATTACKED THE ENTRENCHED VIET CONG POSITIONS AT THE TREE LINEAND ALONG A CANAL BORDERING THE PADDIES ; EACH TIME THEY WERE DRIVENBACK . OVERHEAD, GOVERNMENT PLANES POUNDED THE VIET CONG WITH BOMBS ANDNAPALM, BUT THE COMMUNISTS DID NOT BREAK . " MY GOD, WE GOT A FIX ONONE MACHINE-GUN POSITION AND MADE 15 AERIAL RUNS ON IT, " SAID A U.S .ADVISER . " EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE HAD HIM, AND EVERY TIME THATDAMNED GUNNER CAME RIGHT BACK UP, FIRING . " THE OPEN WALLET . AS DUSKFELL, THE VIET CONG SLIPPED INTO SAMPANS AND ESCAPED DOWN THE DARKENEDCANAL WITH THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED . " EVERYTHING WE DID WENT WRONG, "COMPLAINED A U.S . ADVISER . A BATTALION OF GOVERNMENT PARATROOPERS,ASSIGNED THE JOB OF BLOCKING THE REDS' ESCAPE ROUTE, WAS AIRDROPPEDINTO THE WRONG POSITION . AND WHEN GOVERNMENT ARTILLERY AT LAST STARTEDTO SHELL THE WOODED VIET CONG POSITIONS, THEIR ROUNDS WERE ZEROED IN ONTHEIR OWN TROOPS, KILLED THREE OF THEIR OWN MEN . WORST OF ALL, THEBATTERED VIETNAMESE TROOPS SHOWED LITTLE INTEREST IN PURSUING THE REDS. INSTEAD, THEY SLOSHED THROUGH THE PADDYFIELDS, PICKING UP THEIRCASUALTIES 68 DEAD AND 100 WOUNDED AND POKING THROUGH THE DOWNEDHELICOPTERS . ON THE CABIN FLOOR OF ONE OF THE CHOPPERS LAY THE WALLETOF A DEAD U.S . ADVISER OPEN TO A PICTURE OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD . INALL, THREE U.S . ADVISERS CAPTAIN GOOD, SERGEANT WILLIAM DEAL OF MAYSLANDING, N.J., AND SPECIALIST 4 DONALD BRAMAN OF RADCLIFF, KY . WEREKILLED IN THE AMBUSH, AND SIX MORE WOUNDED . THE DEAD BROUGHT TO 56 THENUMBER OF U.S . TROOPS KILLED SO FAR IN SOUTH VIET NAM . PIECEMEALED TODEATH . THE EXTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT DEFEAT UNDER CONDITIONS OF ITS OWNCHOOSING AND THE HEAVY LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE U.S . HELICOPTERS CAUSEDHEADS TO SNAP FROM SAIGON TO WASHINGTON . UNDER ORDERS FROM PRESIDENTKENNEDY, THE PENTAGON BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICH THE CHOPPERSCAN BE BETTER PROTECTED . IN SAIGON, U.S . ADVISERS ADMITTED THAT THEDAY WAS A " MISERABLE PERFORMANCE, " BLAMED THE DEFEAT ON A " LACK OFAGGRESSIVENESS " BY GOVERNMENT TROOPS . " THEY MOVED IN SLOWLY AND GAVETHE VIET CONG A CHANCE TO PIECEMEAL THEM TO DEATH, " SAID ONE AMERICANOFFICER . STILL, U.S . ADVISERS ARE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS MADE BYGOVERNMENT TROOPS OVER THE PAST YEAR . " CASUALTIES ARE INEVITABLE WHENYOU ARE FIGHTING A WAR, " SAID ONE . " THE VIET CONG ARE IMPROVINGTHEIR ARSENAL AND TECHNIQUES . WE'RE DOING THE SAME AND ON BALANCEWE'RE STILL WAY OUT AHEAD OF THEM .
