WEST GERMANY WAITING FOR THE CALL ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIGERHARD, THAT PUDGY AND POPULAR FELLOW, HAS BEEN ITCHING TO GET HISHANDS ON THE TOP JOB IN WEST GERMANY, AND CAN HARDLY WAIT FORCHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER TO RETIRE AS PROMISED NEXT FALL . HE HASSHYLY NUDGED DER ALTE BEFORE, ONLY TO BE RAPPED HARSHLY ON THE KNUCKLES. LAST WEEK ERHARD PUFFED UP HIS CHEST AND TRIED AGAIN . TO A MUNICHNEWSPAPER, LUDWIG DECLARED HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE OVER RIGHT NOW . " IWOULD BE READY TO ACCEPT A CALL TO THE CHANCELLORSHIP IF MY PARTY ANDTHE BUNDESTAG SO DECIDED, " HE ANNOUNCED, CLEARLY HOPING THAT OTHERSFELT AS HE DID . AFTER ALL, MANY OF WEST GERMANY'S RESTIVE POLITICIANSHAD BEEN GRUMBLING OVER CHARLES DE GAULLE'S COURTSHIP OF DER ALTE,WONDERING WHETHER THE PRICE OF GERMANY'S NEW FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITHFRANCE WAS AN UNACCEPTABLE SUBSERVIENCE TO FRANCE, AND WHETHER ITREQUIRED SIDING WITH THE FRENCH AGAINST BOTH BRITAIN AND THE U.S . NOSUPPORT . BUT WHEN ERHARD SAT BACK TO LISTEN FOR THE EXPECTED CRIES OFSUPPORT, THERE WAS NOTHING BUT SILENCE . HE HAD OVERREACHED HIMSELF .AT THE FIRST CABINET MEETING AFTER ERHARD GAVE OUT HISREADINESS-TO-SERVE INTERVIEW, KONRAD ADENAUER SIMPLY SMILED AND AGREEDWITH EVERY COMPLAINT POOR LUDWIG COULD THINK OF . WOULD THE CHANCELLORFLATLY ENDORSE BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET ? HE DEMANDED .OF COURSE, ADENAUER AGREED BLANDLY . WOULD ADENAUER DECLARE THAT NATOAND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S . WERE THE BASIS OF BONN'S DIPLOMACY? NATURALLY, SMILED DER ALTE . THEN CAME THE CLANGER . WOULD ADENAUERDISASSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM DE GAULLE'S IDEAS OF CREATING A THIRD FORCEBETWEEN EAST AND WEST ? SNAPPED DER ALTE : OF COURSE NOT, NO NEEDFOR IT . DE GAULLE HAD NEVER EVEN DISCUSSED SUCH THOUGHTS WITH HIM ;BESIDES, WEST GERMANY IS OPPOSED TO SUCH A POLICY . RUNNING OUT OFSTEAM AND QUESTIONS ERHARD LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM FOR SUPPORT FROMFOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER AND DEFENSE MINISTER KAI-UWE VONHASSEL . THEY, LIKE ERHARD, ARE PROBRITISH, AND LIKE ERHARD, HAVE GRAVERESERVATIONS ABOUT ADENAUER'S COMRADESHIP WITH DE GAULLE . BUT NEITHERWAS PREPARED TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT ; SCHRODER FOUND A SUDDENFASCINATION IN HIS THUMBNAILS ; VON HASSEL SHUFFLED PAPERS . NEGLECTEDCONSCIENCE . NEXT DAY, AT A CAUCUS OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATSAND THEIR ALLIES, ADENAUER CHIDED ERHARD MERCILESSLY FOR PRESUMING TOSEEK CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT . WHEN THE CABINET FINALLY VOTED ONADENAUER'S DEMAND THAT THE FRANCO-GERMAN PACE BE RATIFIED IMMEDIATELY,ERHARD'S NEIN WAS OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEATED . FOR THE CHANCELLOR, THEREWAS NOW ONLY THE BUNDESTAG TO BE DEALT WITH . KONRAD ADENAUER, 87,HANDLED THE SITUATION WITH DEFT EASE . THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY " ISNOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, " HE TOLD THE ASSEMBLEDLEGISLATORS . " IT IS MERELY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITES . " ASA MATTER OF FACT, DECLARED DER ALTE, DE GAULLE " PROMISED ME THAT THEFIRST SUBJECT OF JOINT CONSULTATION AFTER THE TREATY GOES INTO EFFECTWILL BE BRITISH ENTRY " INTO THE COMMON MARKET . AS FOR THE ATLANTICALLIANCE, " EUROPE KNOWS THAT IT CANNOT DEFEND ITSELF WITHOUT THESUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES . I UNDERLINE AGAIN OUR REPEATEDLYEXPRESSED INTENTION OF ORGANIZING OUR DEFENSE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF NATO/ LUDWIG ERHARD SAT SILENT THROUGHOUT ADENAUER'S PERFORMANCE, SHOWED NOEMOTION EVEN WHEN DER ALTE TURNED TO THE ECONOMIC MATTERS WHICH AREERHARD'S SPECIALITY AND SAID : " CHANCELLOR ERHARD WILL . . . I MEANMINISTER ERHARD . . . " BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE DISSOLVED IN LAUGHTER ASADENAUER PERMITTED HIMSELF A RARE GRIN . " MALICIOUS CRITICS WILL THINKI DID THAT ON PURPOSE, " HE SAID . " BUT I ASSURE YOU I DID NOT . WELL,MAYBE HAVING A LAUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCH A BORING GOVERNMENTSTATEMENT IS A GOOD THING . " AT WEEK'S END, ERHARD WAS RIGHT WHERE HEHAD ALWAYS BEEN, GROPING FOR THE TOP RUNG OF THE LADDER . AND KONRADADENAUER WAS IN HIS ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON TOP .
