THE CONGO THE INDIA-RUBBER MAN JUST AFTER SUNUP ONE DAY LAST WEEK,SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE SLIPPED OUT OF HIS PINK PALACE INELISABETHVILLE, CLIMBED INTO THE BACK SEAT OF A BLACK COMET SEDAN, ANDSPED OFF DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD THE NORTHERN RHODESIAN BORDER . SOON ANARMORED COLUMN OF 500 UNITED NATIONS TROOPS WAS ON HIS TAIL . FOR AMOMENT, IT LOOKED AS IF THE U.N . WERE IN HOT PURSUIT OF ITS OLD FOE .BUT NO ! TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF BUG-EYED NATIVES ALONG THE WAY, MOISEWAS ACTUALLY LEADING THE BLUE HELMETS, URGING HIS OWN TATTEREDKATANGESE GENDARMES TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS SO THE U.N . COULD REOPENVITAL RAIL AND ROAD LINKS . BIZARRE AS IT WAS, THE INCIDENT WAS ANACCURATE INDICATOR OF THE WAY THINGS ACTUALLY WERE GOING LAST WEEK INTHE CONGO'S COPPER-RICH KATANGA PROVINCE, WHERE THE U.N . WAS WAGINGWAR WITH TSHOMBE'S BREAKAWAY REGIME FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER1961 . IN TWO WEEKS, THE TOUGH U.N . TROOPS HAD SEIZED A STEADILYLENGTHENING RIBBON OF RAIL LINES AND NEARLY EVERY MAJOR POPULATIONCENTER IN THE PROVINCE . ONLY THE WESTERN COPPER TOWN OF KOLWEZIREMAINED IN KATANGA'S GRIP ; IT WAS DEFENDED BY 2,000 BOOZY GENDARMES,100 OF TSHOMBE'S WHITE MERCENARIES, AND A SMASHING BLONDE AMBULANCEDRIVER KNOWN AS " MADAME YVETTE, " WHO SAUNTERED ABOUT IN PARATROOPBOOTS, CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM, BUSH HAT AND SHOULDER HOLSTER . ONLY 50MILES FROM KOLWEZI, INDIAN INFANTRYMEN PROBED CAUTIOUSLY FORWARD,WAITING ONLY FOR THE SIGNAL TO HEAD FULL BLAST TOWARD THE TOWN . BUTTHE SIGNAL WOULD NOT BE GIVEN RASHLY, FOR THE RAGTAG MERCENARIESTHREATENED TO BLOW UP A HUGE DAM AND INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATIONS, LEAVINGTHE TOWN A BLACKENED SHELL . THEY MIGHT NOT BE BLUFFING . " I AM BACK ./ BUT WITH FULL BACKING FROM THE U.S . AND THE AFRO-ASIAN NATIONS, THEU.N . WAS DETERMINED TO DICTATE ASETTLEMENT TO TSHOMBE AND MAKE IT STICK . IFIT FAILS, THE REST OF THE CONGO, STARVED OF THE RICHES THAT ENABLEKATANGA TO ACCOUNT FOR 65 PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S EXPORTS, COULDSPLINTER INTO A SCORE OF WARRING TRIBAL DOMAINS . ALREADY A CORPS OF100 CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WAS FLYING INTO ELISABETHVILLE TOTAKE CHARGE OF KATANGA'S ADMINISTRATION . THE BIG QUESTION MARK, ASUSUAL, WAS THE SLIPPERY TSHOMBE . AS THE WEEK BEGAN, HE WAS HOLED UPDEFIANTLY IN KOLWEZI WITH THE MERCENARIES . THERE WERE RUMORS THAT HEMIGHT FLEE TO EUROPE RATHER THAN GIVE IN TO THE U.N . BUT HE WAS NOTSURRENDERING KATANGA'S TOP JOB . LO AND BEHOLD, HE WAS BACK INELISABETHVILLE . " IN SPITE OF ALL THE TROUBLE AND BLOODSHED, " HEDECLARED WITH MACARTHURIAN GRANDEUR, " I AM BACK . " WHAT POLICY WOULDHE FOLLOW ? NO ONE COULD SAY, FOR BEFORE LONG HE WAS BOUNCING WILDLYFROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER . " PURE INDIA RUBBER, " MARVELED AFOREIGN DIPLOMAT . LUMP OF SUGAR . IN THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS, TSHOMBE1) PROMISED TO " ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ANY DECLARATIONS AGAINST THE U.N ./ ; 2) IMMEDIATELY BROKE HIS PROMISE BY THREATENING " A SCORCHED-EARTHPOLICY " IN KOLWEZI (SEE WORLD BUSINESS) ; 3) WAS CLAPPED UNDER HOUSEARREST BY INFURIATED U.N . OFFICIALS " TO RESTRAIN HIM FROM FURTHERIRRESPONSIBLE ACTS " ; AND 4) GOT HIS HOUSE ARREST COMMUTED TO ANIGHTTIME CURFEW BY LEADING THE U.N . TROOPS TO THE RHODESIAN BORDER .THEN, HAVING BAFFLED EVERYBODY, HE VANISHED ONCE MORE FROM THE CAPITAL.WITH TSHOMBE'S KATANGA NOW LARGELY UNDER U.N . CONTROL, CENTRALGOVERNMENT PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA BEGAN FLEXING HIS MUSCLES INLEOPOLDVILLE . HE DEMANDEDTHAT THE BRITISH AND BELGIANCONSULS IN ELISABETHVILLE LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAD ACTED ASMEDIATORS FOR TSHOMBE IN HOPES OF ARRANGING A CEASE-FIRE . HE SPURNED A$2,000,000 GIFT FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS " SUBVERSIVEPOLICY " ON KATANGA, AND ONE OF HIS OFFICIALS SNIFFED : " WE ARE NOT ALITTLE CHILD WHO CAN BE GIVEN A LUMP OF SUGAR TO KEEP QUIET . " BOXSCORE . EXUBERANT AS ADOULA WAS OVER TSHOMBE'S PLIGHT, THERE WAS NOTMUCH FOR HIM TO CROW ABOUT . EVEN IF KATANGA IS SUCCESSFULLYREINTEGRATED, HE WILL STILL FACE THE EQUALLY FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS OFADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE, OFFICIAL CORRUPTION, ARMY INDISCIPLINE ANDWORST OF ALL RIVALRIES AMONG THE CONGO'S 200 TRIBES . THE POINT WASUNDERLINED IN BLOOD LAST WEEK IN KASAI PROVINCE, WHERE FEUDINGTRIBESMEN WERE AT ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS OVER A BORDER DISPUTE . NATIVESKIDNAPED AND REPORTEDLY ATE TWO BELGIAN LUMBERMEN, THEN BEGANSLAUGHTERING ONE ANOTHER IN THE TOWN OF KAKENGE . SUCH GRUESOMEINCIDENTS NO LONGER SURPRISED ANYONE . A LEOPOLDVILLE NEWSPAPERREPORTED THE EVENT AS MATTER-OF-FACTLY AS IF IT WERE A BASEBALL BOXSCORE . ITS HEADLINE : KILLED AT KAKENGE 370 LULUAS, TWO BELGIANS, ONEMUSONGE, ONE KANYOKA .
