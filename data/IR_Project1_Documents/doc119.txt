BACKED BY THEIR OWN HIGH-BOOTED JEWISH POLICE, THE COUNCILSCOMPILED DEATH LISTS OF JEWS AND ROUNDED UP THEIR OWN PEOPLE FORDEPORTATION TO NAZI EXTERMINATION CAMPS . REFUSAL TO HELP EICHMANN'S "TRANSPORTATION " EXPERTS WOULD HAVE MEANT IMMEDIATE DEATH, BUT ALWAYSTHERE WAS THE AGONIZING MORAL DILEMMA : EVEN UNDER DURESS, WASCOOPERATION NOT BETRAYAL ?

FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HE MANAGED TOGET TO ISRAEL IN 1958, BARENBLAT ATTRACTED NO PARTICULAR ATTENTION .THEN, DURING INTRODUCTIONS AT A CONCERT IN A KIBBUTZ, A MEMBER OF THEAUDIENCE SUDDENLY LEAPED UP AND SHOUTED : " BARENBLAT, I REMEMBER YOU! YOU MURDERED JEWS ! " THE CONCERT BROKE UP AMIDST ANGRY CONFUSION. IN 1961, AFTER A POLICE INVESTIGATION, BARENBLAT WAS ARRESTED ANDCHARGED UNDER THE ISRAELI LAW PUNISHING NAZIS AND THEIR COLLABORATORSWHO WERE MEMBERS OF " HOSTILE ORGANIZATIONS " THE SAME LAW UNDER WHICHEICHMANN WAS TRIED AS A GESTAPO MEMBER, AND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT NOWWANTS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE JEWISH POLICE .

ON THE OPENING DAY OF WHAT LOOKEDTO BE A DRAWN-OUT TRIAL, A TEL AVIV CARPENTER TEARFULLY RECALLED THATBARENBLAT'S JEWISH POLICE ONCE TROOPED BACK FROM A ROUND-UP IN BEDZIN "LOUDLY SINGING, AS IF FROM A VICTORIOUS ENGAGEMENT, " DESCRIBED HOWTHEY HERDED JEWISH MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN INTO TRUCKS HEADED FORAUSCHWITZ . " EVEN THE STREETS WEPT, " THE WITNESS SAID . PROSECUTORLIBAI CONCEDED THAT BARENBLAT SAVED " MAYBE TEN OR 20 JEWS, " BUT ADDED: " THIS COURT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SAVE HIS OWN SOUL HE WASENTITLED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF THE JEWISH POLICE . " DEFENSEATTORNEY ARIEH ROSENBLUM, SUPPORTING BARENBLAT'S PLEA OF INNOCENCE,SAID THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS JUSTIFIABLE, AND ARGUED THAT HE WAS ACQUITTEDOF COLLABORATIONIST CHARGES AFTER THE WAR BY A POLISH COURT . " THEJEWISH POLICE, " ROSENBLUM SAID, " CANNOT BE REGARDED AS HOSTILE TO THEJEWISH PEOPLE . THEIR INTENTION WAS NOT HOSTILITY . THEY DID NOT SEEKTO EXTERMINATE JEWS ; THEY SERVED WHAT THEY DEEMED THE BEST INTERESTSOF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY UNDER THE WORST POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES . "
