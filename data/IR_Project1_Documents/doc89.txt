THE ALLIES THE NATO DETERRENT ALMOST AS OLD AS NATOITSELF IS THE " DISARRAY " THAT SEEMS TO HAUNT ITS COUNCILS . YETALLIED DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SO MUCH SYMPTOMS OF ANY DEEP-ROOTED DISUNITYAS THE RESULT OF NATO'S MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS . BECAUSE THEY KNOW THATTHEY ARE SECURE BEHIND THE U.S . NUCLEAR SHIELD, FEW EUROPEAN NATIONSARE EAGER TO BUILD UP CONVENTIONAL FORCES FOR WHICH THEY SEE LITTLE USE. AT THE SAME TIME, AS THEY HAVE GROWN MORE POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS,EUROPEANS HAVE COME TO QUESTION TOTAL U.S . CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONSFOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . THUS DEPENDENCE BREEDS MISTRUST . CHARLESDE GAULLE IS NOT THE ONLY EUROPEAN TO FEAR THAT THE U.S . CANNOT BECOUNTED UPON TO RISK DESTRUCTION OF ITS CITIES IF RUSSIA WERE TO ATTACKWESTERN EUROPE DESPITE REPEATED U.S . ASSURANCES OF ITS LONG-TERMSTRATEGIC COMMITMENT TO EUROPE, AND HEEDLESS OF THE FACT THAT 400,000G.I.S ON THE CONTINENT ARE A PERMANENT U.S . HOSTAGE TO EUROPE'SSECURITY . YET NEITHER FRANCE'S EMBRYONIC FORCE DE FRAPPE NOR BRITAIN'SNEAR-OBSOLETE V-BOMBER STRIKE FORCE CARRIES SUFFICIENT PUNCH TO DETER,LET ALONE DEFEAT, AN AGGRESSOR . FINE WATCHES . LAST WEEK, IN ANATTEMPT TO SOOTHE EUROPE'S RESTIVENESS BY GIVING ITS ALLIES GREATERRESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY, THE U.S . MADE ITS MOST SERIOUSPITCH YET TO SHARE THE PLANNING AND CONTROL OF ATOMIC WEAPONS IN EUROPEWITH EUROPEANS THEMSELVES . BEFORE NATO'S 15MEMBER PERMANENT COUNCIL INPARIS, PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S SPECIAL ENVOY, LIVINGSTON MERCHANT, PROPOSEDCREATION OF A MULTINATIONAL NUCLEAR DETERRENT CONSISTING OF A FLEET OFSURFACE SHIPS EQUIPPED WITH THE U.S . POLARIS MISSILE . KEY PROVISIONOF THE PLAN IS THAT THE SHIPS WOULD BE " MULTIMANNED, " I.E., THEIRCREWS WOULD BE DRAWN FROM EVERY NATO NATION THAT WOULD BE WILLING TOHELP FOOT THE BILL . COST OF THE INTERNATIONAL TASK FORCE WOULD BEABOUT $2 BILLION FOR 200 MISSILES AND THEIR FLOATING LAUNCH PADS ; ITWOULD TAKE AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO BUILD, ABOUT HALF AS MUCH IN TIMEAND MONEY AS IT WOULD TAKE TO CREATE A MULTINATIONAL NUCLEAR POLARISSUBMARINE FLEET . ORIGINALLY, IN FACT, THE U.S . HAD HASTILY SUGGESTEDTHAT MULTI-MANNED, MULTINATIONAL POLARIS SUBMARINES MIGHT BE A LOGICALPROGRESSION FROM THE INDEPENDENT POLARIS SUBS THAT BRITAIN HAS AGREEDTO BUILD (BUT HAS COMMITTED TO NATO) . APART FROM THE COST, HOWEVER,CONGRESS HAS ALREADY INDICATED THAT IT IS DEAD SET AGAINST GIVING U.S .ALLIES THE COMPONENTS OR KNOW-HOW TO BUILD THE SUBMARINES . MOREOVER,OLD NAVAL HANDS ARE AGHAST AT THE PROSPECT OF MANNING SUBMARINES WITHCREWS OF MIXED NATIONALITIES . WARNED A WEST GERMAN NAVAL EXPERT LASTWEEK : " SUB CREWS ARE THE FINE WATCHES OF NAVAL WARFARE . THERE CANBE NO ROOM FOR MISUNDERSTANDING . /FORCE OR FARCE ? AS FOR WHOSE FINGER WILL BEON THE TRIGGER OF THE NEW SURFACE FLEET, THE U.S . AGREES THAT EACHPARTICIPATING ALLY WILL HAVE AN EQUAL VETO . FOR ALL THE ARGUMENT ITPROVOKES, HOWEVER, THE QUESTION OF CONTROL IS LARGELY ACADEMIC ; THEFINGERS WOULD BE UNANIMOUS . " DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT EUROPE WILLWANT TO SHOOT THIS THING OFF WITHOUT BEING SURE THAT THE MAJOR U.S .FORCE WOULD BE USED ? " ASKED A U.S . STRATEGIST . " CONSIDERING ITAS A SECOND STRIKE FORCE, THE SEMANTICS OF VOTING BECOMES IRRELEVANT ./ SEVEN NATO PARTNERS BRITAIN, BELGIUM, ITALY, GREECE, THE NETHERLANDS,TURKEY, WEST GERMANY WERE IMMEDIATELY RECEPTIVE TO MERCHANT'S PROPOSAL. WEST GERMANY EXPRESSED THE WARMEST INTEREST ; THE BRITISH LOOKED ONTHE SCHEME WITH " MILD BENEVOLENCE . " BUT ALL SEVEN WANTED TO HEARMORE ABOUT IT, AND ALLOWED THAT THE PRICE WAS HIGH AND THE PAYOFFDISTANT . MEANWHILE, ALL BUT A FRACTION OF THE EXISTING WESTERN ATOMICSTOCKPILE WOULD REMAIN UNDER U.S . LOCK AND KEY . THE PROPOSAL WASCOLDLY RECEIVED IN FRANCE, WHERE THE GAULLIST DAILY LA NATION EVENDUBBED THE PROSPECT OF A MULTILATERAL FORCE " LA FARCE MULTILATERALE ./ IF THE POLARIS PLAN HAD BEEN TOUTED AS A SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO THEWEST'S DETERRENT, THE GIBE MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED . AS IT WAS, THEJOKE FELL FLAT BECAUSE A JOINTLY MANNED, JOINTLY FINANCED ARMADA MAYACTUALLY OFFER SOLID BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE U.S . AND EUROPE . ARTSCOURSE . FOR THE FIRST TIME, A MULTINATIONAL DETERRENT WOULD ALLOWEUROPEANS TO COLLABORATE WITH THE U.S . FROM SCRATCH IN TARGETING,CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND CONTROL OF ATOMIC WEAPONS ; IT WOULD SATISFYTHEIR ACUTE DESIRE FOR ATOMIC KNOWHOW BY GIVING THEM A THOROUGHEDUCATION IN COMPLEX TECHNOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL NUCLEAR REALITIES .FOR BOTH SIDES, IT WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDED, SUBSTANTIAL TOKEN OFU.S . DETERMINATION TO REMAIN IN EUROPE AND DEFEND ITS ALLIES WITH THEULTIMATEWEAPON, IF NECESSARY . SAYS A U.S . DEFENSE PLANNER : " THIS IS ONETHING THAT CAN PUT GLUE IN THE ALLIANCE . " AS MERCHANT PREPARED TOLEAVE PARIS THIS WEEK FOR A SERIES OF BRIEFINGS ON THE PLAN IN ROME,BRUSSELS, BONN AND LONDON, ANOTHER U.S . DIPLOMAT POINTED OUT AN EVENGREATER INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE : " THOSE NATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TOTHIS FORCE WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MISSILE ARTS IN A YEAR THAN THEFRENCH DO . /
