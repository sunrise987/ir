EUROPE DEADLOCK OR DEATHBLOW ? AS 1963 DAWNED, ITPROMISED TO BE THE WEST'S YEAR OF DESTINY . ITS GREAT HOPE WAS THECOMMON MARKET, WHOSE HISTORIC MARCH TOWARD THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICALINTEGRATION OF WESTERN EUROPE SEEMED AS IRRESISTIBLE AS IT WASIRREPROACHABLE . IT APPEARED ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT BRITAIN WOULD BEADMITTED TO THE COMMON MARKET AND BE FOLLOWED RAPIDLY BY ITS OUTERSEVEN TRADING PARTNERS, FORMING A NEW CONTINENTAL COMMUNITY AS RICH ANDPOPULOUS AS THE U.S . THEN, ARMED WITH BROAD TARIFF-CUTTING POWERSUNDER PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRADE EXPANSION ACT, THE U.S . WAS PREPAREDTO NEGOTIATE WITH EUROPE THE BIGGEST, BOLDEST LIBERALIZATION OF TRADEIN WESTERN HISTORY . FROM ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP, MANY STATESMENBELIEVED, WOULD COME THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK OF AN ATLANTIC COMMUNITY .TIRED OF CONCESSIONS . HOW FAR THIS GRAND DESIGN HAS RECEDED FROMREALITY IS ONLY NOW BECOMING FULLY APPARENT . THE DISINTEGRATIONSTARTED LAST JANUARY, WHEN, AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS, CHARLES DE GAULLEVETOED BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . BUT WHILE OTHERMEMBERS OF THE SIX WERE VARYINGLY IRRITATED BY DE GAULLE'S WAY OFSAYING NON AND DISAPPOINTED BY BRITAIN'S EXCLUSION, FEW AT THE TIMECOULD HAVE PREDICTED THE DEPTH AND DURATION OF DISTRUST THAT DE GAULLEHAS STIRRED IN EUROPE . AMONG THE SIX, WHO HAVE BEEN DEADLOCKED ON ALLMAJOR ISSUES EVER SINCE, THERE IS INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD APPREHENSIONTHAT FRANCE'S ADAMANTLY SELF-CENTERED POLICIES MAY HAVE DEALT THEDEATHBLOW TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS ENVISAGED BY ITS FOUNDERS. IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK, AT AN ANGRY MEETING OF COMMON MARKET FOREIGNMINISTERS, WEST GERMANY'S FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER DECLAREDFLATLY THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS TIRED OF MAKING ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS TOSUIT THE FRENCH, WHILE GERMANY'S DOMINANT INTERESTS ARE IMPERILED BY DEGAULLE'S FOREIGN POLICY GERMANY, WHICH RELIES HEAVILY ON FOREIGN TRADE,IS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE COMMON MARKET'S ISOLATION FROM THE REST OFEUROPE, AND FOR STRATEGIC REASONS IS INCREASINGLY UNEASY AT FRANCE'SALIENATION OF THE U.S . THE SIX, URGED SCHRODER, MUST " TAKE A POSITIVEATTITUDE " TO THE " KENNEDY ROUND " OF TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS, " EVEN IFIT MEANS A SLOWDOWN IN OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT . " FRANCE'S FOREIGNMINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHOSE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID OF U.S .COMPETITION IN EUROPE, REPEATEDLY MUTTERED " ABSURD " AS SCHRODER ANDOTHER FOREIGN MINISTERS PRESSED THEIR CASE . HOWEVER, SCHRODER HAD APOTENT WEAPON . FRANCE, EUROPE'S LOWEST-COST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER, ISDEMANDING THAT THE SIX ADOPT A UNIFORM POLICY ON FARM PRICES BY JULY .SINCE GERMANY WOULD BE FORCED TO FIND NEW WORK FOR AT LEAST A MILLIONOF ITS HIGH-COST FARMERS IF THIS HAPPENS, SCHRODER WARNED THAT HISGOVERNMENT WOULD FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO ADOPT A COMMON AGRICULTURALPOLICY UNLESS FRANCE IN RETURN AGREES TO SEEK THE BROAD RECIPROCALTARIFF CUTS THAT THE OTHER COMMON MARKET NATIONS HOPE TO ACHIEVE INNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S . SIXES & SEVENS . THE MOST EXPLOSIVE ISSUEWAS A DEMAND BY A MAJORITY OF COMMON MARKET NATIONS THAT THE COMMUNITYFORM A PERMANENT COMMITTEE TO MAINTAIN CONSULTATION WITH BRITAIN .AFTER INSISTING THAT THE PALAIS DES CONGRES CAUCUS ROOM BE CLEARED OFADVISERS INCLUDING SEVERAL AMBASSADORS COUVE DE MURVILLE SAID FURIOUSLYTHAT BRITAIN HAD BEEN TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE COMMON MARKET EVER SINCEDE GAULLE'S VETO . SAID HE : " FRANCE CANNOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT THISBRITISH BEHAVIOR . " BUT THE SHOCK WAVES HAVE SPREAD FAR BEYOND THECOMMON MARKET . BRITAIN, WHICH ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD SUCH FAITH INEUROPE THAT IT WAS READY TO SUNDER ITS TIES WITH THE COMMONWEALTH ANDWITH THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION, HAD TO SWALLOW ITS PRIDE INLISBON LAST WEEK AND MAKE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVEN TO KEEP EFTA TOGETHERAT ITS FIRST TOP-LEVEL MEETING SINCE FEBRUARY . THE REASON IS THATBRITAIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT IT WILL PROBABLY NOTENTER EUROPE DURING DE GAULLE'S LIFETIME AND, IF THE COMMON MARKETSHOULD STAGNATE, MAY NEVER JOIN . FRANCE'S DESIGN FOR A NARROW,PROTECTIONIST, THIRD-FORCE EUROPE HAS HAD ITS MOST TRAUMATIC EFFECT ONWASHINGTON, WHICH EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THATTHE U.S . AND EUROPE HAVE COMMON IDEALS AND INTERESTS . LAST WEEK, ONTHE EVE OF A MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS THE SCOPE AND APPROACHOF THE KENNEDY ROUND OF TARIFF CUTS, IT WAS ALREADY PLAIN THAT FRANCEIS AGAIN DETERMINED TO SEEK ITS OWN NARROW SELF-INTEREST, WITHOUTREGARD FOR ITS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS AND WITH EVERY INTENTION OFBLOCKING U.S . HOPES OF EXPANDING TRADE WITH THE NEW EUROPE . INDEED,AS LONG AS THE INNER SIX ARE SPLINTERED AND THE SEVEN REMAIN OUTER,THERE WILL BE NO NEW EUROPE .
