SOUTH VIET NAM OPTIMISM AT HONOLULU, PROBLEMS IN SAIGON IN ADMIRALHARRY FELT'S REINFORCED CONCRETE COMMAND POST HIGH ABOVE PEARL HARBOR,TOP U.S . OFFICIALS LAST WEEK GATHERED FOR THE FIRST EXHAUSTIVE POLICYSTUDY OF SOUTH VIET NAM SINCE THE COUP THAT TOPPLED THE DIEM REGIME THENINE-HOUR CONFERENCE SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK, DEFENSE SECRETARYROBERT MCNAMARA AND JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN MAXWELL TAYLOR HADFLOWN IN FROM WASHINGTON ; FROM SAIGON CAME AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOTLODGE AND GENERAL PAUL HARKINS . THE HONOLULU MEETING EXUDED ALMOSTRELENTLESS OPTIMISM ABOUT THE WAR, AND THE POLICYMAKERS CLUNG BRAVELYTO THE LINE THAT THINGS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY IN HAND BY 1965 TOPERMIT COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF THE 16,500 AMERICAN TROOPS . JUST IN TIME. ONE OF THE FEW CONCRETE DECISIONS LEAKED FROM THE CONFERENCE WAS AHARDLY SURPRISING AGREEMENT TO INTENSIFY ANTI-GUERRILLA OPERATIONS INSOUTH VIET NAM'S RICE BOWL, A WEDGE-SHAPED SECTION OF THE MEKONG DELTAFROM SAIGON SOUTH, WHERE ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATION IS CONCENTRATEDAND THE VIET CONG IS STRONGEST . ANOTHER DECISION : TO REVISE THEGOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM . ALL TOO OFTEN IN THE PAST ,RELUCTANT PEASANTS WERE HERDED INTO BLEAK " FORTIFIED " VILLAGES THATWERE IN FACT INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO HASTILYBUILT . MEANWHILE THE RED GUERRILLAS, WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE STARVINGIN THE NO MAN'S LAND OUTSIDE THE HAMLETS, MANAGED TO LIVE WELL ENOUGHOFF THE LAND . HENCEFORTH, THE PLAN IS TO SEE THAT ALL EXISTINGVILLAGES ARE REALLY DEFENSIBLE AND MORE PLEASANT TO LIVE IN, WITHSCHOOLS AND DISPENSARIES . AS THE CONFERENCE ADJOURNED, THE WAR INSOUTH VIET NAM WAS PROCEEDING FITFULLY . NEW, AGGRESSIVE COMMANDERSREPORTED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS, BUT IN THEDELTA THE COMMUNISTS STILL SEEMED TO HAVE THE INITIATIVE . VIETNAMESEOFFICERS AND MANY OF THEIR U.S . ADVISERS CLAIM THAT BECAUSE OF DIEM'SMILITARY MISMANAGEMENT, THE COUP CAME JUST IN TIME TO KEEP THECOMMUNISTS FROM GAINING COMPLETE CONTROL OF TWO DISPUTED PROVINCESCLOSE TO SAIGON . THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE, BUT THE ARGUMENT OFFERSA BUILT-IN CHANCE TO BLAME DIEM LATER, IN CASE THINGS SHOULD GOSERIOUSLY WRONG . NO MORE SIESTAS . IN SAIGON, LIEUT . GENERAL DUONGVAN ( " BIG " ) MINH, THE HEAD OF THE RULING MILITARY JUNTA, RODE ABOUTALMOST UNNOTICED IN A BLACK CITROEN (IN CONTRAST TO DIEM'S VASTMOTORCADES), VISITING A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND MILITARY UNITS . HEALSO OPENED PROMISING NEGOTIATIONS WITH VIETNAMESE SECTS THAT HADWITHDRAWN SUPPORT FROM DIEM BUT WERE NOT READY TO RALLY TO THE NEWREGIME . BUT WHILE STILL CLEARLY FAVORED BY THE POPULATION, THE NEWREGIME SEEMED ODDLY RELUCTANT TO ASSUME POLITICAL LEADERSHIP . ONE OFITS FEW DECISIONS : TO ABOLISH THE SIESTA THAT HAS TRADITIONALLYCLOSED GOVERNMENT OFFICES FOR 2F HOURS EACH AFTERNOON . DESPITE THEMOURNFUL YAWNS OF CIVIL SERVANTS, THE NEW DECREE ENABLES PEASANTS ANDRURAL OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE THEIR BUSINESS IN THE CAPITAL EARLIER ANDRETURN HOME SAFELY BEFORE DUSK, WHEN THE VIET CONG START HARASSINGTRAFFIC ON ALL THE ROADS RADIATING FROM SAIGON .
