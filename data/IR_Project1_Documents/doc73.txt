ITALY OFF & RUNNING FOR ITALY'S 243 ELECTED SENATORS AND 596DEPUTIES, ALL ROADS LED OUT OF ROME LAST WEEK . GETTING THE JUMP ON THEPRESIDENTIAL DECREE FORMALLY DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT, THE POLITICIANSSCURRIED HOME TO START CAMPAIGNING IN THE FIRST GENERAL ELECTION INFIVE YEARS . IF THE APRIL 28-29 ELECTION WERE ONLY A PERSONALPOPULARITY CONTEST, SHORT (5 FT . 1 IN.), MUSTACHIOED PREMIER AMINTOREFANFANI, 55, MIGHT FIND HIMSELF OUT OF A JOB . FANFANI IS SHREWD, NOTSIMPATICO ,; BEHIND HIS BACK, CRITICS CALL HIM AND HIS AIDES IBASSOTTI (THE DACHSHUNDS) . MORE THAN FANFANI'S LOOKS AND COLDPOLITICAL STYLE ARE AGAINST HIM . A 6 PER CENT JUMP IN LIVING COSTSLAST YEAR TOUCHED OFF A PROLONGED WAVE OF STRIKES BY INDUSTRIAL ANDWHITECOLLAR WORKERS ; FORTNIGHT AGO, 5,000,000 WORKERS QUIT THEIR JOBSIN A ONE-DAY GENERAL WALKOUT . FANFANI'S YEAR-OLD PARTNERSHIP WITHPIETRO NENNI'S LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS, THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENINGTO THE LEFT), HAS SHARPLY DIVIDED THE PREMIER'S OWN CHRISTIANDEMOCRATIC PARTY ; THE COALITION'S MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTTHE NEEDLESS AND EXPENSIVE NATIONALIZATION OF THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY,WHICH WAS NENNI'S PRICE FOR COLLABORATION HAS TURNED MANY BUSINESSMENAGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . STILL, FANFANI FIGURES TO STAY ON TOP . OF THESIX NATIONS IN THE COMMON MARKET, ITALY'S ESTIMATED 6 PER CENT GROWTHRATE THIS YEAR IS THE HIGHEST ; AT ABOUT 1,000,000, UNEMPLOYMENT ISHALF THE 1956 LEVEL . MANY ITALIANS FEAR THAT FLIRTATION WITH THAT OLDSTALIN PRIZEWINNER PIETRO NENNI WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD ITALY DOWN THEPATH TO NEUTRALISM . BUT SO FAR, NENNI HAS PULLED TO THE RIGHT ININTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AWAY FROM HIS LONGTIME COMMUNIST ALLIES . HE HASEVEN HALFHEARTEDLY ENDORSED A NATO NUCLEAR FORCE . NENNI WAS PROBABLYSAVED A LITTLE SOCIALISTIC EMBARRASSMENT WHEN THE U.S . RECENTLY AGREEDTO PULL ITS JUPITER MISSILES OUT OF ITALY .
