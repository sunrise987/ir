GREAT BRITAIN BOBBIES IN TROUBLE WHEN CONSTABULARYDUTY'S TO BE DONE, THE POLICEMAN'S LOT IS NOT A HAPPY ONE . THE PIRATESOF PENZANCE TO THE U.S . TOURIST DRIVING ON THE RIGHT BUT WRONG SIDE OFTHE ROAD, OR HOPELESSLY DEMANDING A DRINK AT MIDNIGHT, THE LONDONPOLICE SEEM PARAGONS OF PATIENCE . WHETHER BREAKING UP A RACE RIOT ORGINGERLY PLUCKING ANTI-NUCLEAR SQUATTERS FROM THE PAVEMENT, THE BRAWNY,PINK-CHEEKED BOBBY ALMOST NEVER RESORTS TO THE PANICKY BRUTALITY OF THEFRENCH FLIC OR THE OFFICIOUS ZEAL OF THE GERMAN POLIZIST . BRITAIN'SPOLICE, ARMED ONLY WITH A NIGHT STICK, STILL BELIEVE IN POUNDING A BEAT. ITS STREETS AND PARKS AFTER DARK ARE AMONG THE WORLD'S SAFEST ; ANDWHILE AN ENGLISH HOUSEHOLDER IS AWAY ON VACATION, LIKELY AS NOT THEBOBBIES WILL KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FRONT DOOR . BUT IN RECENT YEARS, ANDPARTICULARLY SINCE THE PROFUMO-KEELER-WARD SCANDALS, BRITONS HAVE COMETO SUSPECT THAT THEIR POLICE ARE NOT ONLY MARKEDLY LESS PROFICIENT ATKEEPING THE QUEEN'S PEACE THAN OF OLD, BUT MAY ALSO HAVE BECOME LESSSCRUPULOUS IN UPHOLDING THE TRADITIONALLY HIGH STANDARDS OF BRITISHJUSTICE . SMARTER CROOKS . WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING CRIME, IT IS STILLELEMENTARY TO CALL IN SCOTLAND YARD . LAST WEEK, LED BY SUCH WISE OLDBLUEBOTTLES AS COMMANDER GEORGE HATHERILL, 65, THE YARD'S DEAN OFSLEUTHS, WHO SPEAKS EIGHT LANGUAGES AND HAS SOLVED 17 MURDERS, YARD MENINVESTIGATING THE GREAT BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TRAIN ROBBERY SUCCEEDED INROUNDING UP NINE SUSPECTS, RECOVERED $761,367 OF THE $7,000,000 LOOT .ALSO ON HAND WERE ERNEST MILLEN, BOSS OF THE FLYING SQUAD, ALIAS THEHEAVY MOB, WHOSE 100-ODD SLEUTHS KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNDERWORLD THANDANTE ; AND THE TERRIBLE TWINS, TOP DETECTIVES TOM BUTLER AND PETERVIBART, WHO HAVE CRACKED MANY A BIG CASE TOGETHER . YET SO FAR ATLEAST, THE GANG'S RINGLEADERS WERE STILL AT LARGE . EVEN WITHOUT SUCHHUMILIATIONS AT THE HANDS OF MASTER CROOKS, THE LOT OF BRITAIN'S 76,530POLICEMEN IS AN INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY ONE . THE NATION'S POLICE FORCESARE CRITICALLY UNDERMANNED (AUTHORIZED STRENGTH : 82,313), SADLYUNDERPAID (SERGEANT'S PAY AVERAGES $3,000 A YEAR) AND, IN MANY CRITICS'EYES, UNDEREDUCATED . IN RECENT YEARS, POLICE RECRUITS HAVE INCLUDEDNOT A SINGLE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE ; ONLY ABOUT 10 PER CALL NEW BOBBIESHAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA . BRITISH CRIMINALS, BYCONTRAST, ARE BECOMING MORE IMAGINATIVE AND TECHNICALLY PROFICIENTEVERY YEAR . AS FOR SCOTLAND YARD, EVEN ITS STAUNCHEST ADMIRERS ADMITTHAT THE LEGEND TENDS TO OVERSHADOW PERFORMANCE . OF A RECORD NUMBER OFCRIMES REPORTED IN LONDON LAST YEAR, FEWER THAN 25 PER CENT WERE SOLVED; POLICE HAVE RECOVERED NONE OF THE 700,000 STOLEN IN FOUR MAJORROBBERIES FROM ONE BANK DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS .IN THE WOODSHED . AS FOR THE PROFUMOCASE, THOUGH AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO ITS SECURITY ASPECTS IS NEARLYCOMPLETE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN LITTLE ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL LESSENWHAT THE ECONOMIST RECENTLY CALLED " THE ALREADY CUMBROUS WEIGHT OFSUSPICION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NASTY IN THE WOODSHED . " LAST WEEKTHE LABOR PARTY'S " SHADOW " FOREIGN SECRETARY, PATRICK GORDON WALKER,CALLED FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLES PLAYEDTHROUGHOUT BY THE GOVERNMENT, JUDICIARY AND POLICE . AMONG OTHER HINTSOF NASTINESS IN THE WOODSHED, OR THE POLICE STATION, BRITONS WEREPERTURBED BY RECENT CHARGES THAT SCOTLAND YARD HAD BROWBEATEN ACONVICTED PROSTITUTE INTO TESTIFYING AGAINST WARD (SHE LATER RECANTED),AND BY SPECULATION THAT POLICE DELIBERATELY FAILED TO PRODUCE A DEFENSEWITNESS AT THE TRIAL OF " LUCKY " GORDON, THE JAMAICAN SINGER WHO WASIMPRISONED ON CHARGES OF BEATING CHRISTINE KEELER, AND LATERMYSTERIOUSLY FREED . SINCE THERE IS NO WATERTIGHT SEPARATION OFEXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN BRITAIN'S UNWRITTENCONSTITUTION, THE DISQUIETING IMPLICATION TO MANY BRITONS WAS THAT, INITS EMBARRASSMENT OVER THE PROFUMO SCANDAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAD EXERTEDEXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE TO PUT WARD BEHIND BARS . IF SUCH SUSPICIONS AREUNFAIR, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WOULD EVER BE FULLYINVESTIGATED, LET ALONE REFUTED . DANGER TO DEMOCRACY .E MANY OTHERLEGACIES OF 19TH CENTURY BRITAIN, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM SEEMSALMOST TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED NOT TO WORK . TO SOME EXTENT, IT WAS . SIRROBERT PEEL, WHO IN 1829 ORGANIZED THE FIRST MODERN FORCE (AND GAVE THEBOBBIES HIS NAME), ADMITTED TO GRAVE MISGIVINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE USEDAS AN INSTRUMENT OF TYRANNY . UNLIKE A SOLDIER OR CIVIL SERVANT, THEBRITISH POLICEMAN IS NOT A " SERVANT OF THE CROWN " BUT HAS THEAMBIGUOUS LEGAL STATUS OF A UNIFORMED CIVILIAN WHO IS MERELY PAID TO DOWHAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO ON HIS OWN . EVEN TO THIS DAY, MANYBRITONS BELIEVE THAT A STRONG, UNIFIED POLICE FORCE COULD LEAD TO APOLICE STATE . AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE 158 SEPARATE LOCAL FORCES WHOSECHIEF CONSTABLES ARE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THEMSELVES . WHEN A ROYALCOMMISSION IN 1962 RECOMMENDED CONTINUATION OF THIS SYSTEM, COMMISSIONMEMBER A . L . GOODHART AN EMINENT U.S . JURIST WHO WAS THEN MASTER OFOXFORD'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OBJECTED THAT A SINGLE, CENTRALLYCONTROLLED POLICE NETWORK WOULD BE INFINITELY MORE EFFICIENT, AND MOREDEMOCRATIC, THAN THE " EMPTY VELVET GLOVE " WITH WHICH BRITAIN IS NOWTRYING TO DEFEAT ORGANIZED CRIME . " THE DANGER IN A DEMOCRACY, " SAIDHE, " DOES NOT LIE IN A CENTRAL POLICE THAT IS TOO STRONG BUT IN LOCALPOLICE FORCES THAT ARE TOO WEAK . " IN DAY-TO-DAY POLICE WORK, THE LACKOF LIAISON BETWEEN FORCES MORE THAN 50 PER CENT HAVE FEWER THAN 350 MENINEVITABLY HELPS THE CRIMINAL . ANOTHER BOON TO CAREFUL CROOKS : A LAWBY WHICH POLICE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO FILE FINGERPRINTS OF CONVICTEDCRIMINALS, NOT OF SUSPECTS . BUCKINGHAMSHIRE'S CHIEF CONSTABLE,BRIGADIER JOHN CHENY CHENEY (ETON, SANDHURST, INDIA), DID NOT EVENENLIST SCOTLAND YARD'S HELP IN THE TRAIN ROBBERY UNTIL NEARLY A DAYLATER . WHAT WORRIES MANY EXPERTS IS THAT SUCH BUILT-IN INEFFICIENCYCAN ONLY COST BRITAIN'S BOBBIES WHAT REMAINS OF THEIR OLD PRESTIGE . ASIT IS, THEY ARE FIGHTING THE GREATEST CRIME WAVE IN THE NATION'SHISTORY WITH INSUFFICIENT MANPOWER AND INADEQUATE COORDINATION, AMIDDEEPENING PUBLIC DISTRUST THAT SUGGESTS THEIR LOT WILL BE UNHAPPIER YETTHE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, ACABINET MEMBER WHO EARNS $5,600 A YEAR MORE THAN THE PRIME MINISTER,SERVES SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF LEGAL ADVISER, THENATION'S SENIOR JUDGE, TITULAR HEAD OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND SPEAKEROF THE HOUSE OF LORDS .
