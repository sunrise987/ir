THE ALLIES AT LEAST THEY'RE SPEAKING THAW ! CRIED U.S .HEADLINES . OPERATION CHARM ! PURRED THE PARIS PRESS . THE BIG NEWS,OF COURSE, WAS THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK WAS ON SPEAKING TERMSWITH HIS ALLIES . IN PARIS TO ATTEND A MEETING OF THE SOUTH-EAST ASIATREATY ORGANIZATION, SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK CHATTED " CORDIALLY "WITH FRANCE'S PRESIDENT FOR ABOUT 35 MINUTES, COUNTING TIME OUT FORTRANSLATION . BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HOME AND FRANCE'SFOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO HAVE BEEN SNUBBING ONEANOTHER EVER SINCE BRITAIN WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMON MARKET LASTJANUARY, ALSO EXCHANGED CIVILITIES . WHAT'S MORE, AT AN ELYSEE PALACERECEPTION FOR SEATO DELEGATES FROM EIGHT COUNTRIES, LE GRAND CHARLESAFFABLY DECLARED : " SECURITY MEANS COOPERATION . " SUBS, PLEASE . WASTHIS PROGRESS ? SKEPTICS NOTED THAT FRANCE'S GOVERNMENT SEEMED MOREINCLINED TO TALK COOPERATION THAN TO PRACTICE IT . AFTER INDICATINGTHAT THEY MIGHT HONOR A 15-MONTH-OLD AGREEMENT TO ACCEPTU.S.-CONTROLLED WARHEADS FOR ITS GERMAN-BASED F-100 FIGHTERBOMBERS, THEFRENCH BRUSQUELY DENIED THAT THEY HAD ANY PRESENT PLANS " CONCERNINGTHE USE OF THESE PLANES WITHIN NATO . " NOTHING DAUNTED, U.S .OFFICIALS IN PARIS LEAKED WISHFUL REPORTS THAT FRANCE'S NUCLEAR FORCEDE FRAPPE IS BADLY BEHIND SCHEDULE AND BESET WITH EVERMOUNTINGTECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS . DE GAULLE, IT WAS HINTED, WAS ABOUTREADY TO RETURN TO THE NATO FOLD . NOT SO, RETORTED A HIGH-RANKINGFRENCH OFFICIAL . FRANCE, HE INSISTED, WILL HAVE ITS FIRST 50 MIRAGE IVA-BOMBERS IN SERVICE BY DECEMBER 1965, ON SCHEDULE ; EXPECTS TO HAVEITS OWN H-BOMB " WELL BEFORE " 1970 ; AND IS ACTUALLY AHEAD OFSCHEDULE WITH ITS MISSILE-LAUNCHING SUBMARINE, NOW DUE IN 1968 . THUSDE GAULLE HAD NO REASON TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS DECLARED AIM OF NUCLEARINDEPENDENCE . AS THE GAULLIST PARIS-PRESSE POINTED OUT, " IT IS HISPARTNERS WHO HAVE GREATLY CHANGED THEIR TONE " SINCE THE GENERALREJECTED THE U.S . OFFER OF NATO-COMMITTED POLARIS MISSILES LASTJANUARY . THE U.S . WAS STILL PUSHING ITS LONG-TERM PLAN FOR A SURFACEPOLARIS FLEET MANNED BY MIXED CREWS . HOWEVER, BRITAIN HAS LITTLEENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA, WHILE WEST GERMANY AND ITALY, WHICH WERE BOTHENTHUSIASTIC AT FIRST, HAVE NOW INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER SINKTHEIR MONEY IN MULTIMANNED POLARIS SUBMARINES . WHAT THE U.S . DID WINLAST WEEK WAS SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT FROM ITS ALLIES EXCLUDING FRANCE ONTHE GENERAL OUTLINE OF A MORE LIMITED SCHEME, THE INTER-ALLIED,NATOCONTROLLED STRIKE FORCE THAT WASHINGTON HOPES TO CREATE IN THE NEARFUTURE . JUST A GIMMICK ? AFTER A NATO SESSION IN PARIS ANDCONFERENCES IN LONDON ATTENDED BY RUSK, DEFENSE SECRETARY MCNAMARA ANDOTHER TOP POLICYMAKERS, THE U.S . ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD PRESENT NEXTMONTH'S NATO MEETING IN OTTAWA WITH DETAILED PLANS FOR A NUCLEARCOMMAND AND PLANNING STRUCTURE TO INTEGRATE THE NEW INTER-ALLIED FORCE. IT WOULD INCLUDE BRITAIN'S V-BOMBERS AND, IN 1968, ITS POLARIS FLEET,AS WELL AS THREE POLARIS SUBMARINES THAT THE U.S . HAS COMMITTED TONATO, AND OTHER ALLIED AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES . SOME ALLIED PLANNERSDISMISSED THE U.S . PROPOSALS AS MERE " GIMMICKRY . " BUT AFTER ALL ITWAS WESTERN EUROPE THAT HAD BEEN CLAMORING FOR A GREATER ROLE INNUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY . NOW WASHINGTON HAD PRODUCED A PLAN THAT WOULDGO A LONG WAY TOWARD MEETING THIS DEMAND . MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIESSEEMED ANXIOUS TO COOPERATE . PARIS REMAINED STIFFLY ALOOF, SUGGESTINGONLY THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR, ITS OWN DETERRENT MIGHT BE " COORDINATED/ WITH A NATO NUCLEAR FORCE . IF ANY U.S . OFFICIALS REALLY BELIEVED,AS THEY SAID LAST WEEK, THAT THE FRENCH HAD SHOWN A MORE " POSITIVE "ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WESTERN ALLIANCE, THEY GRAVELY MISJUDGED THE AIMSOF CHARLES DE GAULLE . SNAPPED A GERMAN DIPLOMAT : " OF COURSE THECRISIS ISN'T OVER . AND IT WON'T BE AS LONG AS DE GAULLE IS AROUND . "
