ITALY FANFANI'S TEST ALONG THE GRAND CANAL IN VENICE, A HUGE,BRIGHTLY LIT RED-AND-WHITE SHIELD OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTYGLEAMS IN THE NIGHT ; SPROUTING FROM ROME'S JANICULUM HILL,OVERLOOKING THE VATICAN, IS THE RED-WHITE-GREEN FLAME OF THE TINY,POWERLESS FASCISTS . FROM MESSINA TO MILAN LAST WEEK, WIDE PIAZZAS ANDNARROW ALLEYWAYS SPROUTED IN RIOTOUS CAMPAIGN COLORS, AND ECHOED WITHTHE LOUDSPEAKER SLOGANS OF SCUDDING LITTLE FIAT 600S, AS ITALY'S34,300,000 VOTERS PREPARED TO GO TO THE POLLS FOR THE FIRST NATIONALELECTION IN FIVE YEARS . THE ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SINCE 1948,WHEN THE COMMUNISTS WERE DEFEATED IN A CRUCIAL BID FOR POWER . THETHREAT OF A RED TAKEOVER HAS LONG SINCE FADED ; THIS TIME THE MAINISSUE IS CONTINUATION OF THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT),PREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI'S YEAR-OLD EXPERIMENT IN PARLIAMENTARYCOOPERATION WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS . MIXED BLESSING . THE DEALHAS GIVEN FANFANI THE NECESSARY MAJORITY TO INTRODUCE A LONG LIST OFECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS ; IT ALSO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FORISOLATING THE REDS BY FINALLY BREAKING THEIR HOLD ON PIETRO NENNI'SSOCIALISTS . BUT THE APERTURA ALSO OPENS THE WAY TO FAR-REACHINGGOVERNMENT PLANNING AND HIGHER TAXES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE STRONGLYOPPOSED BY LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSMEN ; PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY,LIBERAL PARTY LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, AN ECONOMIC CONSERVATIVE WHOSHARPLY CRITICIZES FANFANI'S FLIRTATION WITH THE LEFT, HAS BEEN DRAWINGLARGE AND ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS . ANOTHER ANXIETY CREATED BY THECENTER-LEFT COALITION IS THAT NEUTRALIST NENNI WILL WEAKEN ITALY'STIES TO THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE . THESE FEARS COULD COST FANFANI'SCHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AS MANY AS 1,000,000 VOTES . AS ALWAYS, THE VATICANIS A HOT CAMPAIGN ISSUE ; THIS TIME, POPE JOHN HAS MADE IT HOTTER THANUSUAL BY MEETING ALEKSEI ADZHUBEI, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S SON-IN-LAW, LASTMONTH, AND OTHERWISE ESTABLISHING FRIENDLIER RELATIONS WITH THE KREMLIN. FORTNIGHT AGO, THE COMMUNIST NEWSPAPER L'UNITA EXAGGERATED POPEJOHN'S RECENT PACEM IN TERRIS ENCYCLICAL AS AN " AN APPEAL FOR PEACEBASED ON NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT . " THIS PROMPTED A PROGOVERNMENTNEWSPAPER TO CRACK THAT THE REDS WERE SUDDENLY " MORE PAPIST THAN THEPOPE . " IN FACT, THE VATICAN IS QUIETLY BACKING FANFANI'S CHRISTIANDEMOCRATIC-SOCIALIST PARTNERSHIP, THOUGH PUBLICLY IT HAS STEERED ANEUTRAL COURSE ; THIS TIME, FOR EXAMPLE, PARISH PRIESTS ARE NOT SAYINGTHAT TO VOTE FOR THE SOCIALISTS IS A GRAVE SIN . USEFUL VISIT . ANOTHERJOHN WHO CASTS HIS SHADOW OVER THE CAMPAIGN IS JOHN F . KENNEDY . THEU.S . HAS SMOOTHLY SHIFTED ITS SUPPORT AWAY FROM CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATICRIGHT-WINGERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THE APERTURA, NOW FAVORSFANFANI'S COALITION . ONE GROUP OF FANFANI SUPPORTERS IS DUBBED THE "KENNEDIANI, " AND THE PREMIER, DASHING ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A BLACKLANCIA, REPEATEDLY RECALLS FOR TOWNSFOLK HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTONAS EVIDENCE OF ITALY'S HIGH STANDING WITH THE U.S . FOR CAMPAIGNPURPOSES EVEN FANFANI'S SOCIALIST ALLIES HAVE BEEN WARMING TO THE U.S .ASKED A SOCIALIST SPEAKER, CONFIDENT OF AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER FROM ACROWD IN BOLOGNA'S PIAZZA MATTEOTTI : " IF KENNEDY WERE IN ITALY,WOULD HE NOT SUPPORT THE OPENING TO THE LEFT ? " PERHAPS HE WOULD .MORE TO THE POINT : WILL THE ITALIANS ? AS THE VOTERS HEAD FOR THEPOLLS THIS WEEK, PREVAILING OPINION WAS THAT THEY WOULD .
