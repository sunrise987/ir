HAS "SCHEDULED THE WITHDRAWAL " OF AN ARMORED CAVALRY REGIMENT FROM GERMANY. SOONER OR LATER IT MAY INDEED BE WITHDRAWN BUT NOT FOR THE TIME BEING. ANYWAY, THE 5,000-MAN REGIMENT PLUS FIVE OTHER REGIMENTS WERE RUSHEDTO GERMANY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE BERLIN CRISIS IN 1961 IN ORDER TOREINFORCE THE SIX U.S . DIVISIONS COMMITTED TO NATO . THESE TEMPORARYREINFORCEMENTS WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK AFTER THE CRISIS EASEDAT A SAVING OF NEARLY $200 MILLION A YEAR IF THE PENTAGON HAD BEENALLOWED ITS WAY . BUT TO PLACATE BONN, THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATIONPROMISED IN SEPTEMBER THAT IT WOULD NOT WITHDRAW ANY TROOPS " WITHOUTCONSULTATION . " THE FUROR IN BONN LAST WEEK FORCED PRESIDENT KENNEDYTO REPEAT, SOMEWHAT WEARILY, THAT THE SIX NATO DIVISIONS PLUS THE SIXADDITIONAL REGIMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMITTED TO NATO WOULD REMAIN ONGERMAN SOIL .

TO MEET ITS NATO COMMITMENTS AS A MATTER OF COURSE, WHILE NEVERCOMING NEAR TO FULFILLING THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS IN THE ALLIANCE . ASONE U.S . OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS LAST WEEK : " FOR A LONG TIME NATOHAS BEEN A 20-MULE-TEAM WAGON, WITH ONE MULE PULLING AND THE OTHERSSITTING IN THE WAGON . IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO GET OUT AND PULL TOO . "
