ITALY BETWEEN LEFT & RIGHT FIFTEEN MONTHS AGO, WHEN ITALIANPREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI MARCHED HIS MODERATE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATICPARTY THROUGH THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT) INTO APARLIAMENTARY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS, HEACKNOWLEDGED THE DEAL AS A DANGEROUS GAMBLE . " WE SHALL CERTAINLY HAVESOME SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, " HE SAID . BY NOW, FANFANI MUST BE A HOPELESSINSOMNIAC . LAST WEEK NEARLY 33 MILLION ITALIANS WENT TO THE POLLS FORNATIONAL ELECTIONS AND REWARDED THEIR EXPERIMENTING PREMIER WITH AJOLTING SETBACK THAT COST HIS PARTY 730,000 VOTES AND MAY WELL COST HIMHIS JOB . THE APERTURA MIGHT SURVIVE, BUT ITS FUTURE LIKE FANFANI'SWOULD BE RISKIER THAN EVER . ASHEN-FACED, THE PINTSIZE (5 FT . 1 IN.)PREMIER FACED REPORTERS IN THE CHIGI PALACE ON ELECTION NIGHT WITHUNCOMMON SHOCK . " THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, " HE DECLARED, " HAVE BEENDECLARED AS THE RELATIVE MAJORITY PARTY, EVEN IF BY A NARROWER MARGINTHAN BEFORE . AND NOW TO BED . " PAPAL PAL . TO BED INDEED . FANFANIALREADY HAD NEWS OF THE MASSIVE GAINS OF PALMIRO TOGLIATTI'SCOMMUNISTS, WHO IMPROVED THEIR POSITION AS THE COUNTRY'S SECOND LARGESTPARTY (AFTER THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS), WON 25 PER CENT OF THE ENTIRENATION'S VOTES, AND 26 NEW SEATS IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES . THE REDSNOW HOLD A TOTAL OF 166 OF THE CHAMBER'S 630 PLACES, COMPARED WITH THECHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' 260 . UNDER THE SHREWD LEADERSHIP OF AGING (70)COMMUNIST BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI, THE REDS HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN CARE TOBALANCE THEIR IDEOLOGY AGAINST THE FACT THAT ITALY IS A CATHOLIC NATION. AT ONE TIME THEY BACKED THE MONARCHY ; NOWADAYS THEY EVEN FAVOR THECAPITALIST COMMON MARKET . AS A NATION, ITALY IS LESS THAN A CENTURYOLD ; FIRST UNDER THE MONARCHY, THEN THROUGH THE LONG NIGHT OFFASCISM, THE COUNTRY HAS HAD LITTLE TIME TO ACCUSTOM ITSELF TODEMOCRACY . THUS, TO MANY ITALIANS, COMMUNISM OR AT LEAST THEIR BRANDOF IT DOES NOT APPEAR THE FEARFUL SPECTER THAT IT DOES IN MANY OTHERLANDS . IN PART, THE COMMUNIST SHOWING WAS DUE TO RED DEFECTIONS FROMPIETRO NENNI'S SHARPLY DIVIDED SOCIALISTS, THE LEFTWING CROWD THAT HADTHROWN ITS LOT WITH FANFANI . AND IN PART IT WAS DUE TO POPE JOHNXXIII, WHO HAD GIVEN A MODICUM OF APPROVAL TO THE FAR LEFT WITH HISPACEM IN TERRIS ENCYCLICAL, AND WITH HIS WARM WELCOME TO THE VATICANLAST MARCH FOR NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S VISITING SON-IN-LAW, ALEKSEIADZHUBEI . NEW LOW . FROM THE RIGHT, APERTURA'S CHIEF CHALLENGE WASAMONG THE FREE-ENTERPRISING LIBERALS, WHO MORE THAN DOUBLED THEIRPREVIOUS VOTE OF 1,000,000 ; THIS WAS A SPECTACULAR GAIN, EVEN IF ITAMOUNTED TO ONLY 7 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL TURNOUT . MOST OF THE CREDITWENT TO TIRELESS LIBERAL CAMPAIGNER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, 58, A BANKERTURNED POLITICIAN, WHO HIT OUT HARD AT FANFANI'S SCHEMES FOR MOREGOVERNMENT PLANNING AND HIGHER TAXES . IT WAS FANFANI'S OWN CHRISTIANDEMOCRATS WHO TOOK THE WORST DRUBBING OF ALL . THE PARTY HAD NO TROUBLEREMAINING IN FIRST PLACE WITH 11.7 MILLION BALLOTS, BUT ON A PERCENTAGEBASIS IT SANK TO THE LOWEST SHARE OF THE TOTAL VOTE (ABOUT 38 PER CENT) SINCE WORLD WAR II . SUMMED UP ROME'S IL MESSAGGERO : INTERNALDISSENSION AND " INCESSANT CLAMOR HAD THE EFFECT OF DRIVING AWAY VOTERS. THE PARTY LOST THE FRIGHTENED, THE CONFUSED AND THE INDECISIVE . " ILMESSAGGERO'S ADVICE TO STOP SQUABBLING WENT UNHEEDED . LAST WEEKRIGHT-WING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, WHO OPPOSED THE APERTURA IN THE FIRSTPLACE, SEIZED THE ELECTION RESULTS AS A SIGNAL TO DEMAND THAT FANFANISTEP ASIDE AS PREMIER IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT PROBABLY TO BE FORMED THISMONTH .
