WEST GERMANY REMEMBRANCE TWO SPECTERS ROSE TO REMIND GERMANS OFEVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE A QUARTER CENTURY AND MORE AGO, BUT HAD STILLTHE POWER TO EVOKE DEEP EMOTIONS . REICHSTAG REVIVED . IN WEST BERLIN,THE REICHSTAG ONCE AGAIN BECAME HABITABLE . A HUGE, FLORID STRUCTURE OFSILESIAN SANDSTONE SINCE 1894 THE HOME OF WHATEVER DEMOCRACY GERMANYKNEW FROM THE DAYS OF BISMARCK THROUGH THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC THE BUILDINGHAD BULKED VACANT AND LIFELESS EVER SINCE IT WAS GUTTED BY FIRE ON FEB. 27, 1933 . THE NAZIS CLAIMED THE FIRE WAS KINDLED BY COMMUNISTS ASTHE SIGNAL FOR A RED UPRISING, AND A CONFUSED DUTCH BOY NAMED MARINUSVAN DER LUBBE WAS BEHEADED FOR HIS ALLEGED PART IN THE CRIME . SINCETHE REICHSTAG FIRE GAVE HITLER A PRETEXT TO GAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OFGERMANY, MOST HISTORIANS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRE WAS SET BY THENAZIS THEMSELVES, POSSIBLY EVEN BY HERMANN GORING IN PERSON . THEREICHSTAG WAS FURTHER DAMAGED BY ALLIED BOMBERS AND BY SHELLFIRE IN THECLOSING DAYS OF WORLD WAR II . THOUGH MANY GERMANS THOUGHT THAT ITSHOULD REMAIN IN RUINS AS A REMINDER OF THE PAST SLOW RECONSTRUCTIONWORK WAS BEGUN IN 1958 . BY LAST WEEK THE SOUTH WING, CONTAINING 45OFFICES, SEVEN CONFERENCE ROOMS AND A PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, WAS FORMALLYREOPENED . IT WILL TAKE ABOUT FOUR MORE YEARS AND AN ADDITIONAL $12.5MILLION TO COMPLETELY RESTORE THE REICHSTAG . UNANSWERED, SO FAR, ISTHE QUESTION OF WHO WILL OCCUPY IT AND WHY . THE BUNDESTAG IS UNLIKELYTO LEAVE BONN FOR BERLIN FOR FEAR OF BRINGING CRIES OF " PROVOCATION "FROM RUSSIA . MOST LIKELY, THE RECONSTRUCTED REICHSTAG WILL STAND EMPTYTHROUGH THE YEARS, SERVING WEST GERMANY AND WEST BERLIN AS A MUTESYMBOL OF THE HOPE OF EVENTUAL REUNIFICATION OF THE NATION .KRISTALLNACHT MOURNED . ALL OVER WEST GERMANY, CEREMONIES MARKED THE25TH ANNIVERSARY OF KRISTALLNACHT (NIGHT OF CRYSTAL), WHEN HITLER'SSTORM TROOPERS WENT ON A NATIONWIDE RAMPAGE AGAINST THE PROPERTY,DIGNITY AND LIFE OF THE 400,000 JEWS WHO HAD NOT YET FLED THEIR GERMANHOMELAND . SYNAGOGUES WERE PUT TO THE TORCH . THOUSANDS OF JEWISHSTORES WERE PLUNDERED AND HAD THEIR WINDOWS SMASHED (HENCE THE NIGHT'SBITTER NICKNAME) . THIRTY-SIX JEWS WERE MURDERED AND 25,000 ARRESTED .THE POGROM HAD BEEN INSPIRED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF GERMAN DIPLOMATERNST VOM RATH IN PARIS BY A 17-YEAR-OLD STATELESS JEW NAMED HERSHELGRYNSZPAN. IT WAS, JOSEPH GOEBBELS TOLD HITLER, A PROPAGANDAOPPORTUNITY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE REICHSTAG FIRE . HITLER AGREED, ANDTHE STORM TROOPERS WERE RELEASED FOR THEIR " SPONTANEOUS " ACTION,WHILE REGULAR POLICE TURNED THEIR BACKS . BOTH GERMAN TELEVISIONNETWORKS LAST WEEK FILLED THEIR PEAK VIEWING HOURS WITH PROGRAMSMERCILESSLY REMINDING GERMANS OF WHAT THEY HAD ALLOWED TO HAPPEN .LEADING NEWSPAPERS DEVOTED ENTIRE PAGES TO RECOLLECTING IN DETAIL THEHORRORS OF KRISTALLNACHT . SAID CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD : " WE MOURNWITH THE SURVIVORS AND WITH JEWRY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD . NO MAN CAN MAKEUP FOR THE INJUSTICE THAT WAS DONE . " ON TOUR IN AFRICA, WEST BERLIN'SMAYOR WILLY BRANDT SENT GREETINGS TO A MEMORIAL SERVICE HELD AT THEREBUILT JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER ON BERLIN'S FASANENSTRASSE .
