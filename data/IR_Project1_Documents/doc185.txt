SOUTHEAST ASIA A LOSING PROPOSITION THE WEST'S MANEUVERS TOCOUNTER THE DISINTEGRATION IN LAOS LAST WEEK WERE LARGELY DIPLOMATIC .IN LONDON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HOME CALLED ON RUSSIACO-ADMINISTRATOR WITH BRITAIN OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS TO SIGN A JOINTAPPEAL THAT THE FEUDING FORCES IN LAOS END THEIR FIGHTING . FEARFULTHAT SUCH PEACE TALK WOULD NUDGE ASIAN COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARIES STILLCLOSER TO RIVAL RED CHINA AND ITS " HARD LINE, " RUSSIA REFUSED, UNLESSTHE STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY BLAMED THE U.S . FOR UNDERMINING THE PEACEIN LAOS . BRITAIN VETOED THE SUGGESTION . PRESIDENT KENNEDY HUSTLEDUNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS AVERELL HARRIMAN, WHOHAD HAMMERED OUT THE BASIC FORMAT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT LAST SUMMER,TO MOSCOW TO URGE ON KHRUSHCHEV THE NEED FOR RUSSIAN INTERCESSION INLAOS . " WE REGARD THE MAINTENANCE OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS AS ESSENTIALTO THE SECURITY OF LAOS ITSELF, " SAID KENNEDY, " AND AS A TEST OFWHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN ACCORD TO BE REACHED BETWEEN COUNTRIESWHICH HAVE SERIOUS DIFFERENCES . " IN MOSCOW, HARRIMAN WAS RECEIVEDCOOLLY ; ONLY A JUNIOR PROTOCOL OFFICER WAS AT THE AIRPORT TO MEET HIM. WHEN HE GOT TO THE KREMLIN, HE FOUND KHRUSHCHEV MORE THAN HAPPY TOGIVE VAGUE ENDORSEMENT OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS, BUT LESS THAN WILLING TOTAKE ANY CONCRETE ACTION TO STOP THE FIGHTING IN THE PLAIN OF JARS.THE ROAD BUILDERS . AS THE DIPLOMATS TALKED, THE PENTAGON WAS QUIETLYFLEXING ITS MUSCLES . UNITS OF THE U.S . SEVENTH FLEET BEGAN CRUISINGIN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND THOUGH THE MOVE HAD BEEN PLANNED FORMONTHS, WASHINGTON PICKED LAST WEEK TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWO COMBAT-READYBATTLE GROUPS WOULD SOON MOVE INTO THAILAND TO TAKE PART IN NEXTMONTH'S FULL-SCALE SEATO BATTLE MANEUVERS . IT WAS REMINISCENT OF THECRASH BUILDUP OF TROOP STRENGTH IN THAILAND JUST A YEAR AGO, WHEN THELAST SERIOUS FLARE-UP IN LAOS TOOK PLACE . LEFT BEHIND WHEN THESETROOPS WERE WITHDRAWN WERE ENOUGH TRUCKS, TANKS AND PERSONNEL CARRIERSTO EQUIP A THIRD BATTLE GROUP THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED IN THE EVENT OFEMERGENCY . THEPLAIN IS NAMED FOR THE SCORES OF LARGE, STONE BURIAL URNS DOTTING THEAREA, IN WHICH THE ANCESTRAL ASHES OF THE LAOTIAN PEOPLE WERE ONCEDEPOSITED . BOTH THE PATHET LAO AND THE NEUTRALISTS AVOID FIGHTING NEARTHE JARS, FOR LAOTIAN TRADITION HOLDS THAT THE PENALTY FOR DISTURBINGTHEM IS A VIOLENT AND FIERY RETRIBUTION FROM THE SPIRITS WITHIN .APART FROM THE COMBAT TROOPS, SOME 2,600OTHER U.S . MILITARY PERSONNEL CHIEFLY ENGINEERS AND SIGNAL TROOPS AREIN THAILAND . NEAR THE LAOTIAN BORDER, A U.S . ARMY CONSTRUCTIONBATTALION IS NEARING COMPLETION OF AN ALLWEATHER JET AIRSTRIP . AT AMEETING WITH TOP U.S . AIDES IN BANGKOK, ADMIRAL HARRY D . FELT,COMMANDER OF ALL U.S . FORCES IN THE PACIFIC, DISCUSSED CONTINGENCYPLANS IN THE EVENT THAT THE PATHET LAO MOVES OFF THE PLAIN OF JARS INTOTHE MEKONG RIVER VALLEY . THE U.S . IS NOT COMMITTED TO PUT TROOPSINTO LAOS,AND THE MILITARY IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF FIGHTINGTHERE, FOR THE LACK OF AIRFIELDS, RAILROADS AND GOOD ROADS WOULD MAKEIT TOUGH TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS . BUT IF THE PATHET LAO SHOWED ANINCLINATION TO SWEEP ALL THE WAY SOUTH, THE U.S . FORCES IN THAILANDMIGHT WELL HAVE TO MOVE ACROSS THE MEKONG AND OCCUPY THE LAOTIANCAPITAL OF VIENTIANE AND OTHER STRATEGIC POINTS IN THE VALLEY .MEANWHILE IN LAOS ITSELF, A LULL HAD SETTLED OVER THE BATTLEFIELD . INA FLYING VISIT TO THE PLAIN OF JARS, NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMAMANAGED TO ARRANGE A SHAKY CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN THE PATHET LAO AND KONGLE'S NEUTRALISTS . THOUGH SPORADIC ARTILLERY DUELS STILL POCKMARKED THEPLAIN, THERE WERE NO OUTRIGHT RED ATTACKS, AND THE NEUTRALISTS LOST NONEW TERRITORY . BUT HOSTILITIES THREATENED TO ERUPT FROM ANOTHERQUARTER . AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE PLAIN, RIGHT-WING GENERAL PHOUMINOSAVAN WAS REINFORCING HIS POSITIONS, AND IN THE FOOTHILLS BEHIND THEPATHET LAO LINES, TOUGH, WELL-ARMED MEO TRIBESMEN, WHO HAVE NO LOVE FORTHE REDS, POSED A DANGEROUS THREAT TO COMMUNIST SUPPLY ROUTES FROMNORTH VIET NAM . IF LAOS SHOULD FALL TO THE REDS, NORTH VIET NAM'S HOCHI MINH TRAIL (SEE MAP), THE SUPPLY ROUTE WHICHCUTS THROUGH THE LAOTIAN THICKETS TO COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS INSOUTH VIET NAM, WOULD OPEN UP, PERMITTING THE REDS TO POUR ARMS AND MENINTO THAT EMBATTLED LAND . CONTROL OF LAOS' MEKONG RIVER VALLEY WOULDALSO GIVE THE COMMUNISTS A HIGHWAY FOR SUBVERSION OF NEIGHBORINGCAMBODIA AND THAILAND, WHICH IN TURN WOULD INCREASE RED PRESSURE ONBURMA AND MALAYA . FAIT ACCOMPLI . FOR THE MOMENT, THE REDS APPEAREDCONTENT TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR NEW TERRITORIAL GAINS ON THE PLAIN OF JARSAND TO LET THE CRISIS COOL OF ITS OWN ACCORD . IF THEY MOVED OFF THEPLAIN, THEY WOULD SURELY MARCH RIGHT INTO A CIVIL WAR WITH PHOUMI'SRIGHTIST FORCES, THUS INVITING U.S . INTERVENTION, WHICH THEY WISHED TOAVOID AT ALL COSTS . DESPITE PROTESTS BY BOTH SOUVANNA AND THE U.S.,THE PATHET LAO'S TERRITORIAL GRAB WAS A FAIT ACCOMPLI . THERE WERETHOSE IN THE U.S . WHO THOUGHT THE ONLY LONG-RANGE ANSWER TO THE LAOSPROBLEM WAS OUTRIGHT PARTITION . ALREADY A DE FACTO PARTITION OF LAOSEXISTED : THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS FIRMLY CONTROLLED BYTHE COMMUNISTS, AND THE RICE-RICH MEKONG RIVER VALLEY WAS IN THE HANDSOF THE RIGHTISTS . IT WAS NOT THE IDEAL SOLUTION FOR LAOS . BUT, AS ONEU.S . OFFICIAL SAID " THERE ARE NO GOOD SOLUTIONS IN LAOS . THERENEVER WILL BE . LAOS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LOSING PROPOSITION . /
