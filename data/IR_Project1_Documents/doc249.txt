APART FROM THEIR DISLIKE OF TAKING ORDERS FROM ANYONE,THEY KNOW THAT FREQUENTLY IN THE HEM OF HIS NATTY BLUE CAPE IS SEWNENOUGH BUCKSHOT TO BREAK A MAN'S AND SOMETIMES A WOMAN'S NOSE . THEYHAVE SEEN HIM WADING INTO A CROWD FLAILING A 6-FT . RIOT CANE LIKE ASCYTHE . PARISIANS RECALL MANY BLOODY HEADS ACROSS THE YEARS,ESPECIALLY THE NINE PEOPLE KILLED IN THE CRUSH WHEN POLICE BROKE UP A1962 PEACE RALLY . BUT THE LATEST UPROAR BEGAN IN APRIL, WHENCINEMACTOR JEAN-PAUL (BREATHLESS) BELMONDO DARED TO PROTEST THAT A COPWAS NEGLECTING AN ACCIDENT VICTIM WHILE QUIZZING WITNESSES ; BELMONDOWAS KNOCKED FLAT . DURING MAY, FOUR PRISONERS DETAINED FOR TRIFLINGOFFENSES HANGED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CELLS . THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TOPROVE THAT THE POLICE WERE AT FAULT, BUT NO ONE COULD CONVINCESUSPICIOUS FRENCHMEN THAT THE DEATHS WERE NOT CAUSED BY THIRD-DEGREETACTICS .

THEY STILLISSUE PASSPORTS, LICENSE EVERYTHING FROM PROSTITUTION TO DRIVING, ANDKEEP CLOSE TRACK OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF EVERYBODY IN PARIS .
