ANANY EGOROVICH BIT HIS LOWER LIP . HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. EIGHT YEARS AGO HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THESE WOMEN BY THE SCRUFF OFTHEIR NECKS AND THROWN THEM INTO THE FIELDS . BUT NOW . . . " A WIFEWITH A JOB . MYSOVSKY VISITS A FATHER AND SON WHO DO NOT WORK REGULARLYFOR THE KOLKHOZ, YET OCCUPY A GOOD HOUSE . HOW DO THEY DO IT ? " WHATARE THE MEANS ? ANANY EGOROVICH ASKED HIMSELF . THE KOLKHOZ WAGES ?CERTAINLY NOT, SADLY ENOUGH . WHO COULD BUILD THEMSELVES A HOUSE ?THOSE WHO HAVE EARNINGS ON THE SIDE . THERE IS A CUSTOM IN THE VILLAGE: IF YOU WORK IN A KOLKHOZ, LOOK FOR A WIFE WHO HAS A REGULAR JOB INTOWN . " EVERYONE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR HIMSELF AND EARN MORE THAN WORKFOR THE COLLECTIVE, HE LAMENTS . " IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY . A REALVICIOUS CIRCLE . IN ORDER TO BE PAID WELL, PEOPLE SHOULD WORK FULLSTEAM, SINCE THE KOLKHOZ HAS NO OTHER RESOURCES BUT THEIR WORK . BUTPEOPLE WILL NOT WORK FOR THE KOLKHOZ BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WELL PAID .HOW CAN I BREAK THE CIRCLE ? PARTY OFFICIALS TELL ME, " YOU'RE NOT AGOOD LEADER . YOUR AGITATION-EDUCATIONAL WORK IS SLACK.' BUT HOW DO YOUPROPAGANDIZE TODAY'S KOLKHOZNIK ? WITHOUT THE RUBLE THE AGITATIONDOESN'T REACH HIM . . . THAT'S THE WHOLE QUESTION . " WHY BOTHER ?CONTINUING HIS TOUR, MYSOVSKY STOPS OFF AT THE NEW HOME OF A RELEASEDINMATE OF A SLAVE LABOR CAMP . THE FELLOW HAS A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATETHAT HE IS TOO ILL TO WORK, LIVES LAVISHLY BY SELLING PRODUCE FROM HISPRIVATE PLOT . " EVERYTHING AT PETUNYA'S PLACE WAS GEARED TO MARKETNEEDS . INSTEAD OF A SMALL ONION BED HE HAD A REAL ONION PLANTATION,MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES ON THE KOLKHOZ . THEN THERE WERE CUCUMBERS,POTATOES . . . EVERY INCH WAS USED . " NATURALLY PETUNYA REFUSES TO HELPBRING IN THE HARVEST . " IF I HAD A COW I MIGHT, BUT OTHERWISE, WHYBOTHER ? ' THE CHAIRMAN UNDERSTANDS . . . EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OFACRES OF HAY ARE LOST BECAUSE KOLKHOZNIKI GET ONLY 10 PER CENT OF THEHAY THEY HARVEST . IN ORDER TO FEED HIS OWN COW HE WOULD HAVE TOHARVEST ENOUGH FOR EIGHT OR NINE AND THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE . EACH YEAR ITGETS HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND WORKERS FOR THE KOLKHOZ SILO . " MEETINGHIS FATE . AT THE END OF HIS ROUNDS MYSOVSKY IS DOG-TIRED ANDDEPRESSED, STOPS OFF AT THE RECREATION HALL FOR A DRINK, AND PROMPTLYGETS PLASTERED . WHILE DRUNK HE PROMISES THE WORKERS 30 PER CENT OF THEHARVEST INSTEAD OF THE REGULATION 10 PER CENT , AND LO AND BEHOLD, WITHTHAT INCENTIVE, THEY ARE OUT IN THE FIELDS EARLY NEXT DAY . NEXTMORNING, MYSOVSKY WAKES UP WITH A HANGOVER, RUBS HIS EYES AT THE SIGHTOF WORKERS' KERCHIEFS BOBBING LIKE DAISIES IN THE FIELDS . THEN HEREMEMBERS . . . " THIRTY PERCENT ? HOW COULD HE HAVE SAID ANYTHING OFTHE SORT ? HIS HEAD MIGHT FALL FOR THAT . HE COULD IMAGINE THE CRIESOF THE PARTY BOSSES : " YOU HAVE UNLEASHED PROPERTY-POSSESSING IDEAS .YOU LET YOURSELF BE LED BY BACKWARD ELEMENTS.' JUST THE SAME, THOUGHTTHE CHAIRMAN, THE WORKERS WERE OUT IN THE FIELDS JUST BECAUSE OF THEPROMISE OF 30 PER CENT WITHOUT SHOUTING, DEMANDS OR DISCUSSION . "MYSOVSKY HASTILY WALKED TOWARD THE HOME OF THE LOCAL PARTY BOSS TOEXPLAIN THINGS BEFORE THEY PUT HIM ON TRIAL . THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THEHOUSE, THE MORE FRIGHTENED HE BECAME . ON THE WAY, AN ASSISTANT STOPPEDHIM, ASKED WHETHER HE WANTED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WORKERS TO OUTLYINGFIELDS NATURALLY FOR THE SAME 30 PER CENT . " MYSOVSKY NERVOUSLY LICKEDHIS LIPS, THEN AGREED . NOW THAT I AM 55, I SHOULD BE COURAGEOUS, HESAID TO HIMSELF . HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP, AND WENT INSIDE TO MEETHIS FATE . /
