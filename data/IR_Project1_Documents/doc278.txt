ISRAEL VALE ATQUE AVE IN JERUSALEM, HALO-HAIRED PREMIER DAVIDBEN-GURION, 76, HANDED IN HIS RESIGNATION FOR THE EIGHTH TIME IN HIS 15YEARS IN OFFICE . ISRAEL WAS NOT UNDULY DISTURBED, SINCE BEN-GURION ISAS FAMED FOR RESIGNATIONS AS FOR SUCH OTHER IDIOSYNCRASIES AS STANDINGON HIS HEAD AND ADVOCATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH GERMANS . BUT WHATSTARTLED PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS THIS TIME WAS THE FACT THAT BEN-GURIONALSO GAVE UP HIS PARLIAMENTARY SEAT IN THE KNESSET, AN ACT THAT WOULDLEAVE HIM INELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE CABINET OFFICE . ASKED WHY, BENGURIONFIRMLY REPLIED, " PERSONAL NEEDS . I PROPOSE TO KEEP THEM TO MYSELF . "WEARY CHIEF . IN FACT, BEN-GURION WAS WEARY OF POLITICS AND DISTURBEDBY A RISING GENERATION THAT QUESTIONS HIS LEADERSHIP . HIS MAPAI PARTYWAS IRREVOCABLY SPLIT BY THE 1960-61 LAVON AFFAIR, WHICH ALSO TANGLEDTHE ARMY IN POLITICS. BEN-GURION HAS CONTINUALLY HAD TO ARBITRATEDISPUTES AND PACIFY ANTAGONISTS . FINALLY, HE HAS NEARLY DESPAIRED OFREDUCING THE MULTIPLICITY OF PARTIES (15 IN ALL), DESPITE HIS ARGUMENTTHAT " IF THE U.S . WITH HUGE POPULATION CAN GET ALONG WITH TWOPARTIES, WHY CAN'T WE WITH ONLY 2,000,000 PEOPLE ? " B-G " WAS NOTTOO WEARY OF POLITICS TO HAND-PICK HIS SUCCESSOR : UKRAINIANBORNFINANCE MINISTER LEV ESHKOL, 67, WHO HAS BROUGHT ISRAEL FROM AHAND-TOMOUTH ECONOMY TO THE POINT WHERE ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HASRISEN AN AVERAGE OF 11 PER CENT ANNUALLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, ANDITS DOLLAR SURPLUS IS ALMOST AN EMBARRASSMENT . TWICE MARRIED BUT NOW AWIDOWER, ESHKOL HAS FOUR DAUGHTERS, ONE OF WHOM TEACHES DANCING INJERUSALEM, WHILE ANOTHER IS A SERGEANT IN THE ISRAELI ARMY . HIS NEWCABINET STRONGLY RESEMBLES BEN-GURION'S OLD ONE, AND IT IS UNLIKELYTHERE WILL BE ANY RADICAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC POLICY . A FARMORE ADAPTABLE MAN THAN BEN-GURION, ESHKOL WILL PROBABLY GOVERN MORETHROUGH COMPROMISE THAN BY FIAT . PET PROJECT . THE GOVERNMENTALTRANSITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT THAT, SURE ENOUGH,BEN-GURION SUDDENLY WITHDREW HIS RESIGNATION FROM THE KNESSET, ONCONDITION THAT HE WOULD ONLY ATTEND PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS IF HE FELTLIKE IT . NEITHER ESHKOL NOR THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WERE TOO HAPPYABOUT BEN-GURION'S KEEPING HIS FOOT IN THE DOOR . NOW, SHOULD ESHKOLFALTER OR A CRISIS THREATEN, BEN-GURION MIGHT CHARGE BACK INTO OFFICETO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM ALLEGED DISASTER . MEANWHILE, BEN-GURION PLANSTO LIVE AT THE SDE BOKER KIBBUTZ IN THE BLEAK NEGEV DESERT AND TURN OUTBOOKS ON EVERYTHING FROM JEWISH HISTORY TO HIS OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY . HEHOPES ALSO TO FURTHER HIS PET PROJECT : THE " CULTURAL ABSORPTION " OFJEWISH IMMIGRANTS FROM ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA INTO ISRAEL'SPREDOMINANTLY WESTERN SOCIETY . BEN-GURION ARGUES THAT UNLESS THEORIENTAL JEWS ARE EDUCATED FASTER, ISRAEL MAY TURN INTO A TYPICALLY "INDOLENT " LEVANTINE STATE WITHIN TEN YEARS .ISRAELI DEFENSEMINISTER PINHAS LAVON WAS FORCED FROM OFFICE IN 1955 ON ALLEGATIONSTHAT HE DISASTROUSLY BUNGLED AN ISRAELI ESPIONAGE ABROAD, PRESUMABLY INEGYPT . LAVON PLEADED THAT HE HAD BEEN FRAMED BY HIGHLY PLACEDPOLITICAL ENEMIES . HE WAS FINALLY CLEARED TWO YEARS AGO BY THE ISRAELICABINET, OVER BEN-GURION'S VIOLENT OBJECTIONS .
