MIDDLE EAST DANGER : PROFESSOR AT WORK TOURING THEMIDDLE EAST UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT, DUKEELLINGTON AND HIS BAND FOUND THEMSELVES CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A COUPIN IRAQ LAST WEEK . FASCINATED BY THE GOINGS-ON, THE DUKE PROMISED TOCOMPOSE A NEW PIECE, " THE BAGHDAD ROCK AND I DO MEAN ROCKING WITHROCKETS, BOMBS AND ALL . " THE DUKE MIGHT JUST AS WELL WRITE ANOTHERPIECE CALLED THE DAMASCUS REEL, FOR SYRIA, TOO, UNDERWENT A SHAKE-UP,QUIETER BUT NO LESS SIGNIFICANT . BEHIND THE SUDDEN SHUFFLE OF MIDDLEEASTERN LEADERS WAS A POWER STRUGGLE INSIDE A STRANGE NEW POLITICALFORCE, THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH IN LITTLE LESS THAN A YEARHAS TURNED FROM A SHADOWY, CLANDESTINE MOVEMENT WITHOUT POPULAR SUPPORTINTO A DYNAMIC POWER CHALLENGING GAMAL ABDEL NASSER FOR LEADERSHIP OFTHE ARAB WORLD . THE AVOWED AIM OF BAATH IS TO UNITE IRAQ AND SYRIA,WHICH IT ALREADY CONTROLS, AND TO ADD ALL OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES TO THISUNION, THROUGH PERSUASION OR SUBVERSION . LAST WEEK'S TUSSLES WERECAUSED PARTLY BY THE CLASH OF AMBITIONS WITHIN THE PARTY, PARTLY BYDIFFERENCES OVER HOW QUICKLY AND RADICALLY THE BAATH AIMS SHOULD BEPURSUED . OUT OF THE SHADOWS . IN SYRIA, PREMIER SALAH BITAR, 52, ACO-FOUNDER OF THE BAATH PARTY, RESIGNED AFTER BEING ACCUSED IN PARTYCOUNCILS OF " SELF-ISOLATION FROM THE MASSES . " TRANSLATION : HE MUSTMAKE WAY FOR AN AMBITIOUS, YOUNGER RIVAL . THE RIVAL : AMIN HAFEZ, 42,SYRIAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND A TOP PARTY LEADER, WHO TOOK OVER ASPREMIER . AS A PRELUDE TO HIS SWEARINGIN, JETS WHOOSHED OVERHEAD INSALUTE AND TO DISCOURAGE ANY POSSIBLE TROUBLE . IN IRAQ, THE STRUGGLEWAS BETWEEN BURLY VICE PREMIER ALI SALEH SAADI, A RADICAL, AND AFACTION OF MODERATES HEADED BY FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB SHABIB ANDINTERIOR MINISTER HAZIM JAWAD . SAADI AND HIS FRIENDS WANT MORE OR LESSINSTANT SOCIALIZATION OF THE IRAQI ECONOMY, CRACKDOWN ON THE MIDDLECLASS, REVOLUTION THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD, AND AN ANTI-WESTERN POLICY. SHABIB, JAWAD & CO . FAVOR A SLOWER, MORE CONCILIATORY COURSE . ATFIRST IT LOOKED LIKE A CLEAR VICTORY FOR THE MODERATES . BACKED BYGUN-TOTING AIDES, SHABIB AND JAWAD SEIZED SAADI AND THREE OTHER CABINETMINISTERS, BUNDLED THEM INTO A MILITARY PLANE WITHOUT LUGGAGE AND FLEWTHEM TO EXILE IN MADRID WHERE SAADI KEPT HINTING THAT HE WOULD YETRETURN TO IRAQ IN TRIUMPH . NEXT MORNING SAADI'S SUPPORTERS IN THELABOR UNIONS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD POURED INTO THE STREETS OF BAGHDAD,LED BY AIR FORCE COLONEL MUNZER WANDARI, A FIERCELY MUSTACHIOED FANATICWHO PERSONALLY TOOK UP A JET FIGHTER AND STRAFED THE PRESIDENTIALPALACE WITH ROCKETS . WHEN THE MODERATES CALLED ON THE ARMY FOR HELP,TROOPS CLEARED THE STREETS AND JAILED WANDARI . BUT HE HAD APPARENTLYMADE HIS POINT . AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE BAATH HIGH COMMAND DECIDEDUPON A PLAGUE-ON-BOTH-YOUR-HOUSES GESTURE : SHABIB, JAWAD AND FIVEAIDES WERE HUSTLED INTO ANOTHER PLANE AND SENT INTO EXILE TOO IN BEIRUT. STRANGELY SILENT IN THE UPROAR WAS THE ONE NON-BAATHIST IN A POSITIONOF POWER, IRAQ'S PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO WAS REPORTEDLY UNDERPALACE ARREST . UNTIL PARTY ELECTIONS ARE HELD SOME TIME NEXT YEAR,IRAQ WILL APPARENTLY BE RUN BY THE BAATH CENTRAL COMMITTEE (WHICHINCLUDES A JORDANIAN, A LEBANESE AND A KUWAITI AS WELL AS IRAQI ANDSYRIAN GENERALS) AND BY MICHEL AFLAK, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND REALPOWER IN THE PARTY . IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT AFLAK, A WITHDRAWN,SEEMINGLY GENTLE INTELLECTUAL WHO HAS SANCTIONED THE EXECUTIONS OFHUNDREDS OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS, EMERGED FROM HIS SHADOWY POSITIONBEHIND THE SCENES . NATIONAL FAMILIES . WHAT PRECISELY IS BAATH ?NASSER SEEMS TO CONSIDER IT AN EVEN GREATER THREAT THAN HIS OLDENEMIES, THE ARAB MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, AND COMPLAINS: " I HAVE READ EVERY BOOK BY OR ABOUT BAATH AND I COULD UNDERSTANDNOTHING . " A WESTERN DIPLOMAT DESCRIBES IT AS AN " ARAB COSA NOSTRA ./ ON THE CONTRARY, ONE KNOWLEDGEABLE OBSERVER THINKS BAATH " ISPROBABLY AHEAD OF ITS TIME REFORMIST, PROGRESSIVE AND SECULAR IN AWORLD OF ARABS BOUND BY TRADITION, RELIGION AND NARROW, PERSONALINTEREST . " FOUNDER AFLAK, 53, WHOSE SCHOLARLY MANNER HAS WON HIM THENICKNAME " THE PROFESSOR, " DEFINES BAATH THROUGH HIS CAREER AS MUCH ASTHROUGH HIS WORDS BORN IN DAMASCUS TO THE GREEK ORTHODOX FAITH IN ANOVERWHELMINGLY MOSLEM ENVIRONMENT (AFLAK'S FATHER WAS A MODERATELYSUCCESSFUL GRAIN MERCHANT, AND HIS MOTHER, NOW 75, IS STILLILLITERATE), AFLAK GOT HONORS IN HISTORY AT THE SORBONNE . IN PARIS HEARGUED POLITICS WITH OTHER AFRO-ASIAN STUDENTS, READ MARX, NIETZSCHEAND JEFFERSON . HE SAYS, " I QUICKLY FOUND MARXISM INADEQUATE, BASED ONMATERIALISM WITHOUT HUMAN AND SPIRITUAL VALUES, WITHOUT NATIONALCONSCIOUSNESS . NATIONS ARE ONLY LARGE FAMILIES, AND THE ARAB FAMILYNEEDS MORE THAN MARX . THUS WE EVOLVED THE BAATHIST DOCTRINE OFSOCIALISM MINGLED WITH NATIONALISM AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT . " RETURNINGTO DAMASCUS AS A TEACHER, AFLAK WAS SOON INDOCTRINATING STUDENTS IN HISREVOLUTIONARY IDEALS, DRAWING SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO WERE OVEREDUCATED,UNEMPLOYED SONS OF THE POOR . IN 1942, AFTER LEADING A STRIKE AGAINSTFENCH HISTORY TEXTS BEING USED IN SYRIAN SCHOOLS, HE QUIT TEACHING ANDBECAME A FULLTIME AGITATOR, DRAWING SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO, LIKEHIMSELF, WERE OVEREDUCATED, UNDEREMPLOYED SONS OF PEASANTS AND WORKERS. THE LUMINOUS CLASSICAL ARABIC OF HIS POLITICAL TRACTS FILLS BAATHISTSWITH ECSTASY, BUT IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION, HIS IDEAS SEEM RATHER MURKY: " NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE " ; " REVOLUTION ISTHE OPPOSITION OF TRUTH TO THE EXISTING SITUATION . " AFLAK WROTEBAATH'S DEMOCRATIC-SOUNDING CONSTITUTION IN FIVE DAYS, AND IT HAS NEVERSINCE BEEN CHANGED OR, FOR THAT MATTER, IMPLEMENTED .BY 1947, AFTER THE FRENCH LEFTSYRIA, BAATH HAD 1,000 CAREFULLY SELECTED MEMBERS, AND AFLAK CALLED THEFIRST NATIONAL CONGRESS IN A DAMASCUS CAFE . TWO YEARS LATER HE WASSTRONG ENOUGH TO HELP TOPPLE A SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND SERVED IN THECABINET FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE RESIGNING ON THE GROUND THAT HE WAS OFMORE VALUE TO BAATH OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT THAN IN IT . COLLIDINGAMBITIONS . AFLAK WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN BY THE 1948 ARAB DEFEAT INPALESTINE . DURING THE FIGHTING HE PROWLED THE FRONT, LIVING WITH ARABTROOPS . " THE ARAB SOCIAL STRUCTURE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISASTER,/ HE SAYS . " A SOCIETY BASED ON DISUNITY AND INEQUALITY PREVENTED THEARABS FROM REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL . " TODAY HE IS AS VOCAL ASANY ARAB LEADER ABOUT DRIVING THE ISRAELIS INTO THE SEA . AT FIRST,BAATH WORKED WILLINGLY WITH NASSER . AT THE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS IN1956, BAATH DECIDED ON THE UNION OF SYRIA WITH EGYPT THAT WASACCOMPLISHED TWO YEARS LATER . BUT THE RIVAL AMBITIONS OF NASSER ANDBAATH COLLIDED . SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT IN 1961 AND BECAME ABAATH-DOMINATED STATE AFTER A MILITARY COUP LAST MARCH . BAATH HADALREADY WON BLOODY CONTROL OF IRAQ A MONTH EARLIER AND TELEVISED THEGORY SCENE OF THE EXECUTION OF DICTATOR KASSEM . SINCE THEN, BAATH HASSUCCESSFULLY AND BLOODILY PUT DOWN TWO NASSERITE INSURRECTIONS IN IRAQAND FIVE IN SYRIA, AND ITS LEADERS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY BITTER ABOUTNASSER . SAYS ONE : " WE LOVED HIM AND CHERISHED HIM, THE BASTARD .NASSER IS A LOST PROPHET . HE TRIES TO ANNIHILATE US, THE DEVIL . WEARE IDEALISTS AND DON'T WANT TO KILL, BUT HE MAKES US KILL . WE HAVE TOUSE HIS TACTICS, DAMN HIM . " THE EGYPTIAN PRESS AND RADIO IN TURNPICTURE AFLAK AS A COMBINATION OF ROBESPIERRE, STALIN, BEN-GURION ANDTHE POPE . WHENEVER CAIRO RADIO MENTIONS HIM, IT IS FOLLOWED BY THEINTERJECTION " YANI, YANI " (I MEAN, I MEAN), GIBING AT THE FUZZINESSOF HIS POLITICAL CONCEPTS . TOTAL HOSTILITY . BAATH DEPENDS ON 50,000PARTY MEMBERS SCATTERED IN EIGHTMAN CELLS THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD . "WE COULD TAKE IN THOUSANDS MORE, " AFLAK BOASTS, " BUT WE MUST SCREENOUT OPPORTUNISTS, IDLERS AND ENEMY AGENTS . " NOT ONLY NASSER, BUT ALSOARAB MONARCHS, BUSINESSMEN AND THE TRADITIONAL, MIDDLE-CLASSPOLITICIANS DETEST BAATH . ARAB CHRISTIANS FEAR BEING SUBMERGED IN AUNITED ARAB STATE . THE KURDISH TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE MOSLEMS BUT NOTARABS, HAVE WAGED A LONG, BITTER WAR FOR AUTONOMY IN NORTHERN IRAQ .ORIGINALLY, THE COMMUNISTS WERE NUMBERED AMONG THE MANY FOES OF BAATH,AND IN IRAQ WERE HUNTED DOWN AND EXECUTED, WHILE MOSCOW RAILED AGAINST/ BAATHIST GENOCIDE . " BUT RECENTLY, PERHAPS IN A SEARCH FOR ALLIES, ABAATH OFFICIAL IN IRAQ ANNOUNCED THAT " THE RED HUNT IS OVER, " ANDHUNDREDS OF COMMUNISTS WERE RELEASED FROM JAIL . COMMUNIST LEADERS AREJOINING BAATH IN CALLING FOR " THE LIQUIDATION OF FEUDALISM, " AND THEBAATH PARTY NEWSPAPER PROCLAIMS " TOTAL HOSTILITY GAINST CAPITALISM . "STILL BETTING THAT IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHILE ANTI-WESTERN, WILL REMAINANTI-COMMUNIST, THE U.S . THIS YEAR IS SUPPLYING CREDITS AND LOANS OFMORE THAN $60 MILLION . IN TAKING OVER, BAATH FOUND BOTH COUNTRIESNEARLY BANKRUPT AND HAS TRIED TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY WITH SOCIALISTCURE-ALLS RANGING FROM NATIONALIZATION OF INDUSTRY (INCLUDING, INSYRIA, THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS) TO CONVERTING STATE LAND INTO FARMCOLLECTIVES . FOR STRATEGIC REASONS, A PAVED HIGHWAY FROM BAGHDAD TODAMASCUS IS BEING PUSHED TO COMPLETION . THIS YEAR'S RICH COTTONHARVEST PROMISES A $100 MILLION WINDFALL FOR SYRIA, AND IRAQ'S COFFERSARE BEING REFILLED BY OIL REVENUES . BRAINWASHING . AS SET UP BY AFLAK,THE ORGANIZATION OF BAATH RESEMBLES THAT OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY . EACHCELL ELECTS A LEADER, CELL LEADERS ELECT DISTRICT CHIEFS AND SO ON, UPTO THE VARIOUS REGIONAL CONGRESSES . OVER THEM STANDS THE POWERFULCENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHICH REALLY RUNS THE WHOLE SHOW . IN DEALING WITHPOLITICAL OPPONENTS, BAATH TENDS TO RELY ON THE FIRING SQUAD, BUT BAATHMEETINGS ARE CONDUCTED STRICTLY BY ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER . MEMBERSHIPIS GAINED ONLY AFTER A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS AS A CANDIDATE " ON TRIALFOR SINCERITY AND INTENSITY . " BAATHISM IS BEING EXTENDED TO THESYRIAN AND IRAQI ARMIES IN ADDITION TO MILITARY DUTY EACH SOLDIER MUSTSPEND TWO HOURS A DAY BEING POLITICALLY INDOCTRINATED . BAATHIST POLICEOFFICIALS ARE NOW TRYING THEIR HAND AT BRAINWASHING POLITICALPRISONERS, AND BOAST THAT THEY HAVE EVEN CONVERTED COMMUNISTS . AS LASTWEEK PROVED, BAATH CAN BE AS HARD ON ITS OWN LEADERS AS ON ITS ENEMIES. MICHEL AFLAK, AS SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE BAATH CENTRAL COMMITTEE,HAS SURVIVED AS THE ONLY STABLE ELEMENT IN BAATH . HE HAS NEVER MADE ARADIO OR TV SPEECH, SELDOM APPEARS IN PUBLIC, BUT HE IS A VIRTUOSO INMAN-TO-MAN DISCUSSIONS, AND PREMIERS, CABINET MEMBERS AND GENERALSDUTIFULLY REPORT TO HIM FOR " ADVICE . " IN FACT, MANY OF THE DECISIONSIN LAST WEEK'S WHOLESALE FIRINGS OF BAATH LEADERS WERE HAMMERED OUT INAFLAK'S MODEST, FOUR-ROOM DAMASCUS APARTMENT, WITH WASH FLAPPING ON THEBALCONY AND HIS TWO SMALL CHILDREN PLAYING UNDERFOOT UNTIL THE CRISISFORCED HIM TO FLY TO BAGHDAD AND TAKE CHARGE PERSONALLY . HE WASPLAINLY RELUCTANT TO DO SO . " I STAY AWAY FROM POWER, " HE SAYS . " IAM INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING . " AFLAK IS CONFIDENT OF ACCOMPLISHING ALLHIS VISIONARY GOALS IN HIS OWN LIFETIME . SAYS HE : " WE HAVE MANYINTELLECTUALS IN THE PARTY, BUT NOT ENOUGH EXECUTIVE AND TECHNICALTALENT . WE NEED MORE TRAINED CADRES . WE NEED MORE FUNDS . WE NEEDMORE TIME . WE NEED MORE OF EVERYTHING . " THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS WHETHERBAATH'S OLD ARAB ENEMIES AND NEW COMMUNIST ALLIES AS WELL AS ITS OWNIMPATIENT RADICALS WILL ALLOW THE PARTY THE TIME IT NEEDS . MEANWHILE,DOES AFLAK EVER HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT BAATH'S VICTIMS ? HE SAYS : "WE ONLY DREAM ABOUT OUR DESTINY . /
