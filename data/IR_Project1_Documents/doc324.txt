THE FAITHTHAT LIGHTS THE FIRES THE READINESS OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHIST MONKSAND NUNS TO BURN THEMSELVES TO DEATH AS A MEANS OF PROTEST AGAINST THEGOVERNMENT BOTH MOVES AND REPELS THE WEST . ON THE SURFACE, IT SEEMS ANODD PHENOMENON IN A RELIGION GENERALLY REGARDED AS PASSIVE, GENTLE ANDFULL OF REVERENCE FOR LIFE . THE PARADOX IS CAUSED BY THE FACT THATBUDDHISM, THOUGH DETACHED AND OTHERWORLDLY, CAN AT TIMES CONVULSEITSELF INTO ACTION, AND THAT ITS VIEW OF LIFE AS TRANSITIONAL CAN LEADTO AN ALMOST INDIFFERENT EMBRACE OF DEATH .SELF-IMMOLATION IS NOTMERELY A SIT-IN CARRIED TO ORIENTAL EXTREMES . ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOTOCCURRED OFTEN AND APPARENTLY NEVER BEFORE IN VIET NAM THE PRACTICE ISDEEPLY LINKED TO THE BASIC NATURE OF BUDDHISM, THE WORLD'S FOURTHLARGEST RELIGION . NIRVANA & DHARMA . BUDDHISM CONSISTS OF THREESPIRITUAL COMPONENTS, TWO TRADITIONS, AND A MULTIPLICITY OF SECTS . THEFIRST OF THE THREE COMPONENTS, COMMON TO ALL BUDDHISTS, IS THELEGENDARY LIFE OF A HANDSOME INDIAN PRINCE NAMED GAUTAMA, WHO, ABOUT600 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST, ABANDONED HIS LUXURIOUS EXISTENCE AFTER SEEINGFOUR FACTS OF LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME : A SICK MAN, AN OLD MAN, A DEADMAN AND A HOLY MAN . HE FLED TO THE FOREST TO SEEK ENLIGHTENMENT, TRIEDAND ABANDONED THE WAYS OF THE HERMIT AND THE ASCETIC, AND, AFTERMEDITATING UNDER A SACRED BODHI TREE FOR 49 DAYS, AT LAST ACHIEVEDBUDDHAHOOD ENLIGHTENMENT, OR NIRVANA . HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFEWALKING THROUGH INDIA WITH HIS DISCIPLES, TEACHING UNTIL HE DIED AT 80,LEAVING A FINAL ADMONITION : " WORK OUT YOUR SALVATION WITH DILIGENCE. " GAUTAMA'S TEACHING, THE SECOND CHIEF COMPONENT OF BUDDHISM, ISSUMMED UP IN THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS : 1) MAN SUFFERS ALL HIS LIFE, ANDGOES ON SUFFERING FROM ONE LIFE TO THE NEXT ; 2) THE ORIGIN OF MAN'SSUFFERING IS CRAVING FOR PLEASURE, FOR POSSESSIONS, FOR CESSATION OFPAIN ; 3) THE CURE FOR CRAVING IS THE PRACTICE OF NONATTACHMENT TOEVERYTHING EVEN TO THE SELF ; 4) THE WAY TO NONATTACHMENT IS THEEIGHTFOLD PATH RIGHT VIEWS, RIGHT INTENTIONS, RIGHT SPEECH, RIGHTCONDUCT, RIGHT LIVELIHOOD, RIGHT EFFORT, RIGHT MINDFULNESS, RIGHTMEDITATION . THE BUDDHA SAID NOTHING ABOUT GOD ; NO DIVINE JUDGMENT,BUT AN INEXORABLE LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT CALLED DHARMA DETERMINESMAN'S WEAL OR WOE . THIRD ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF BUDDHISM IS THE VASTBODY OF MONKS AND NUNS CALLED THE SANGHA . IN ADDITION TO CELIBACY ANDVEGETARIAN NONVIOLENCE, MONKS PRACTICE POVERTY ; TRADITIONALLY THEONLY POSSESSIONS PERMITTED ARE ROBES, A BEGGING BOWL FOR FOOD, ANEEDLE, PRAYER BEADS, A RAZOR (TO SHAVE THE HEAD ONCE A FORTNIGHT), ANDA FILTER TO REMOVE BUGS FROM THE DRINKING WATER SO AS NOT TO KILL THEM. GREATER & LESSER VEHICLES . THE TWO GREAT BUDDHIST TRADITIONS AREHINAYANA AND MAHAYANA . HINAYANA, THE SO-CALLED LESSER VEHICLE, ISGENERALLY MORE AUSTERE AND UNCOMPROMISING ; IT HOLDS THAT ONLY MONKSAND NUNS HAVE HOPE OF REACHING NIRVANA . MAHAYANA, THE GREATER VEHICLE,OFFERS HOPE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO LAYMEN AS WELL, AND STRESSES THECOMPASSIONATE CONCERN OF THE BUDDHA FOR HUMANITY . THE HIGHEST MAHAYANAIDEAL IS THE BODHISATTVA, OR ENLIGHTENED ONE, WHO SACRIFICES HIMSELFFOR OTHERS, AND MAHAYANA MYTHOLOGY CONTAINS NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OFSACRIFICES AS AN ACT OF LOVE AS WELL AS A MEANS OF LIBERATION . ZENBUDDHISM, ONE OF THE SUBDIVISIONS OF MAHAYANA, IMPORTED BY THE JAPANESEFROM CHINA, EMPHASIZES A COMBINATION OF PROLONGED MEDITATION AND SHOCKTO ACHIEVE SATORI, OR ENLIGHTENMENT .VIET NAM'SBUDDHISM, LIKE CHINA'S AND JAPAN'S, IS PREDOMINANTLY MAHAYANA, AND THESUICIDE MONKS AND NUNS KNEW THE NUMEROUS LEGENDS OF BODHISATTVAS'PHYSICAL SACRIFICES, SUCH AS THAT OF THE HOLY MAN WHO GAVE HIS BODY TOA FAMISHED TIGRESS TO KEEP HER FROM EATING HER CUBS . SOME MAHAYANAMONKS STILL AID THEIR LIBERATION FROM THE BODY BY BURNING THE FINGERSOFF THEIR LEFT HANDS, AND IN THE 6TH CENTURY BEFORE GASOLINE MONKS WHODECIDED TO IMMOLATE THEMSELVES COMPLETELY WOULD EAT WAXY AND FATTYFOODS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO THEY WOULD BURN BETTER . THEORETICALLYBUDDHISM DOES NOT PERMIT SUICIDE, AND THE WORD IS CAREFULLY AVOIDED INFAVOR OF " SACRIFICE . " ONE OF GAUTAMA'S TESTAMENTS, THE LOTUS SUTRA,AS INTERPRETED BY MONKS IN SAIGON, CALLS FOR ALL BUDDHISTS TO SACRIFICETHEMSELVES IF THEIR RELIGION IS IN DANGER . ONE EARLY BUDDHIST MARTYR,IT IS SAID, TOOK HIS LIFE BY FIRST PUNCHING HIS BODY FULL OF HOLES ANDSEALING THEM WITH OIL, THEN SETTING FIRE TO HIMSELF . FEASTS & MAGIC .THE GRASS-ROOTS MAHAYANA BUDDHISM IN THE VIET NAM VILLAGES IS A LONGWAY FROM SUCH GRIM PRACTICES . IT USUALLY TAKES THE FORM OF THEEASYGOING AMIDISM, IN WHICH A PARADISE CALLED " PURE LAND " AWAITS THEINTENSE FAITHFUL WHO REPEATS A SIMPLE PRAYER . IT IS STRONGLYINFLUENCED BY THE MAGICAL PRACTICES OF CORRUPTED TAOISM, IMPORTED FROMCHINA AROUND THE 7TH CENTURY, AND BY CONFUCIANISM, WHICH STRESSESETHICAL BEHAVIOR . CONFUCIUS EMPHASIZED FAMILY OBLIGATIONS, EVIDENTSTILL IN VIET NAM'S ANCESTOR WORSHIP AND CULT OF THE DEAD . THE 15THDAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH IS SET ASIDE ANNUALLY FOR THE DEPARTED ; THESHADES SWOOP DOWN UPON THE LIVING, WHO DO THEIR BEST TO PLACATE THEMWITH A SUMPTUOUS FEAST . DRESSED IN THEIR BEST BLACK SILK AND CARRYINGBURNING JOSS STICKS, THE WOMEN RECITE INVITATIONS TO THEIR DEADANCESTORS TO PARTAKE OF ROAST PIG'S HEAD AND STICKS OF SUGAR CANE,PEANUTS AND WHITE RICE . AS OFFERINGS TO LESS TRENCHER-MINDED SPIRITS,THEY BURN PAPER IMITATIONS OF CURRENCY AND CLOTHES . CRUSADER & YOGI .IN MANY WESTERN EYES, BUDDHISM IS SOCIALLY USELESS . IT HAS ONLY ALIMITED TRADITION OF GOOD WORKS ; THE CHIEF DUTY OF MONKS AND NUNS ISCONTEMPLATION . IN THE LOTUS AND THE ROBOT, ARTHUR KOESTLER SAYS OFORIENTAL MYSTICISM IN GENERAL : " THE MESIANIC ARROGANCE OF THECHRISTIAN CRUSADER IS MATCHED BY THE YOGI'S ARROGANT ATTITUDE OFDETACHMENT TOWARDS HUMAN SUFFERING . " ACTUALLY, BUDDHISTS ARE QUITECAPABLE OF THE CRUSADING SPIRIT . IN CEYLON DURING THE 2ND CENTURYB.C., A KING LED HIS ARMY AGAINST INDIAN INVADERS WITH A RELIC OFBUDDHA IN HIS SPEAR . IN VIET NAM AND ELSEWHERE, BUDDHISTS OFTEN TOOKAN ACTIVE PART IN FIGHTING AGAINST COLONIAL POWERS . DURING THE KOREANWAR, AT LEAST SOME BUDDHISTS WERE PREACHING THAT " TO WIPE OUT THEAMERICAN IMPERIALIST DEMONS IS NOT ONLY BLAMELESS BUT MERITORIOUS . "IGNORING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS' CRUEL PERSECUTION OF BUDDHISM INTIBET, SOME BUDDHISTS REASON (AS ONE SCHOLAR PUTS IT) THAT WHEN THEMARXISTS' MATERIAL NEEDS ARE SATISFIED, THEY WILL " NEED SOMETHINGSPIRITUAL ABOVE AND BEYOND, " AND THAT BUDDHISM WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLYIT . IT IS THIS SORT OF SELF-DELUSION EXISTING ALONGSIDE BUDDHISM'SNOBILITY OF SPIRIT THAT MAKES THE EIGHTFOLD PATH SO FULL OF PITFALLS .
