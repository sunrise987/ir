BUT AS IT TURNED OUT, JUNDI, AFTER THREE SLEEPLESS DAYS ANDNIGHTS OF TRYING TO PERSUADE BOTH SIDES TO COOPERATE, WEARILY STEPPEDASIDE TO LET ANOTHER PREMIER SEEK A SOLUTION . WHO WAS THE NEW PREMIER? NONE OTHER THAN BITAR, WHO PROMPTLY FILLED THE NASSERITE CABINETVACANCIES WITH BAATH SUPPORTERS AND TIGHTENED THE PARTY'S GRIP OVER THEARMY, THUS COMPLETING A PURGE THAT HAD ALREADY SENT TWO PLANELOADS OFOFFICERS SUSPECTED OF EGYPTIAN LEANINGS INTO EXILE . WITHIN HOURS OFTHE ANTINASSER STROKE IN SYRIA, MUCH THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN IRAQ .THERE TWO NASSERITES WERE DUMPED FROM THE CABINET AND WERE REPLACED BYMORE PLIABLE FELLOWS . CAIRO WAS ENRAGED AT BAATH'S " TRICKERY,TREACHERY AND TERRORISM . " THUNDERED EGYPT'S AL GUMHURIA :. "PUNISHMENT FROM GOD IS SURE TO COME . OR IF NOT FROM GOD, FROM NASSER .
