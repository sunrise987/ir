SWEDEN GENTLEMAN SPY THE TALL, COLDLY HANDSOME SWEDISH AVIATORWAS A FAMILIAR FIGURE ON THE WASHINGTON COCKTAIL CIRCUIT . AS SWEDISHAIR ATTACHE FROM 1952 TO 1957, HE IMPRESSED ONE U.S . AIR FORCE GENERALAS " EASY AND OUTGOING, AN EXTRAVERT WHO GOT ALONG VERY WELL . " WESTPOINTERS FOUND HIM " SPOONY " MEANING SUAVE . HE PLAYED A COOL, QUIETGAME OF GOLF AT THE ARMY-NAVY CLUB, HIS BALDING, WHITE-FRINGED HEADBENT OVER HIS PUTTER AS GENERALS AND ADMIRALS CHATTED . HISCONVERSATION WAS HARDLY MEMORABLE, EXCEPT THAT HE WORRIED ALOUD AND ALOT ABOUT RADICALS AND LEFTISTS . WHEN HE WENT HOME, THE U.S .GOVERNMENT PRESENTED HIM WITH THE CUSTOMARY LEGION OF MERIT FOR HIS "FURTHERANCE OF AMICABLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ROYAL SWEDISH AIRFORCE AND THE U.S . AIR FORCE . " LAST WEEK, AS COLONEL STIG ERIKCONSTANS WENNERSTROM, 56, AWAITED TRIAL AS A SOVIET SPY, IT WASSUDDENLY CLEAR THAT HIS RELATIONSHIPS HAD BEEN MOST AMICABLE EAST OFTHE IRON CURTAIN . WHAT DAMAGE ? WHEN SWEDISH AGENTS ARRESTED HIM, HEADMITTED HE HAD BEEN ON THE SOVIET PAYROLL FOR A FULL 15 YEARS NOT ONLYAS AN AIR ATTACHE BUT AFTER 1957 AS CHIEF OF THE AIR SECTION IN THESWEDISH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, AND SINCE 1961 AS A FOREIGN MINISTRYCONSULTANT . THOUGH HE DREW ONLY $9,000 ANNUAL PAY, HE LIVED IN A$40,000 HOUSE IN STOCKHOLM'S EXCLUSIVE DJURSHOLM DISTRICT, AMONG BANKDIRECTORS AND DIPLOMATS, ENTERTAINED FREQUENTLY . MONEY WAS A MOTIVE(HE MAY HAVE EARNED AS MUCH AS $100,000 FOR HIS WORK), BUT ONEACQUAINTANCE SAID : " HE MUST HAVE ENJOYED THE DANGEROUS GAME ANDTHOUGHT HE WAS INTELLECTUALLY BETTER THAN OTHERS . " WHAT DAMAGE COULDWENNERSTROM'S GAME HAVE DONE TO THE U.S., NATO, AND HIS OWN COUNTRY ?THOUGH SWEDEN IS NOT A NATO MEMBER, WENNERSTROM HAD CONTACT WITH DANISHAND NORWEGIAN MILITARY MEN, PROBABLY KNEW A LOT ABOUT THE NATO DEFENSESAND WEAPONS . HE ALSO KNEW SWEDISH DEFENSE SITES AND STRENGTHS, HADACCESS TO KEY MOBILIZATION AND COMMUNICATION PLANS . IN WASHINGTON, HEHAD ACCESS AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE U.S .ARMY'S HAWK, RADAR-GUIDED ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILE DESIGNED TO KNOCK DOWNLOW-FLYING SUPERSONIC PLANES . THE RUSSIANS ARE WORKING HARD TO PERFECTA DEFENSE AGAINST LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR ATTACK, AND THE HAWK COULD HELPTHEM . MORE PROOF ? SWEDISH MINISTER OF DEFENSE SVEN ANDERSSON WASSUSPICIOUS OF WENNERSTROM FOR TWO YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ARREST, BUTPREMIER TAGE ERLANDER WAS NOT INFORMED UNTIL AFTER AGENTS HAD PICKED UPWENNERSTROM ON THE WAY TO HIS OFFICE . AS OPPOSITION CRITICS POUNCED,ERLANDER WENT ON TELEVISION TO EXPLAIN : " IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEGOVERNMENT TO BE INFORMED OF EVERY PERSON WHO IS UNDER SUSPICION . WENEED MORE PROOF IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BEFORE WE CAN TAKE ACTION . "IT SOUNDED LIKE A LAME EXCUSE TO LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, WHODEMANDED A PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION . MEANWHILE, ALWAYS THEGENTLEMAN, WENNERSTROM REPORTEDLY ASKED HIS ATTORNEY TO SEND BACK HISLEGION OF MERIT, CALMLY FACED A PROBABLE LIFE SENTENCE FOR " GROSSESPIONAGE .
