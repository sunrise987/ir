EUROPE A NEW & OBSCURE DESTINATIONIN AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH PARTNERS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLYMINDFUL OF ONE ANOTHER'S SENSITIVITIES, IN WHICH VICTORIES WERETACTFULLY NOT CROWED OVER, AND TOGETHERNESS IN ITSELF WAS REGARDED AS AGOOD THING, CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK REMINDED THE WORLD OF WHAT ONEMAN WITH A WILL CAN DO . OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE ANDON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENTFOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USEDTO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED ININFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOINGBRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLEABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OFDETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUTOUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTICALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT INQUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST !HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEADMECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WESTGERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A "BLACK DAY, " DECLARING THAT " THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISMAND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . " ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'SCHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET,THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTEDTHAT " THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . " BRITAIN'SPRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : " WHATHAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THEWHOLE WORLD . " , " BRUTAL " WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALLAND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECTOR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S .POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . " MOST UNFORTUNATE, " SAID THESTATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THEINEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS'SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE " TEMPORARY ABERRATION " OF THEMAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THECOMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICEOPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOTSPEAK OF AN " AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL " OF ITS RELATIONS WITH ARECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY ANDDIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITYTWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN,AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED INMOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATIONOF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILLINEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR " INNER CONTRADICTIONS . " CRIED ARUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : " THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEANCOMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OFSTATE . " NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONETORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHEDHIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THATTIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN ANDMONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND$1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTESAND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OFU.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPERALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OFDEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DEGAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWNREALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OFTHE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONYTHAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION ANDSELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVERSINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUTQUITE THIS WAY .PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE .THAT THEY DID IS THERESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 .HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BEENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TOHIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES,SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGUREOF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLYSURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLEPICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBSWITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFTFOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DEGAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT,TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUDOF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANYAGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKIN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGNFOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BYTHE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANSOF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONEPRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE " GRAND DESIGN, "IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKEDIN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THELIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA,ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S .INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BYTHE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRANDDESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BYEUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'SEUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITYAND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHEROF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCHLEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE,LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'SRIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE " STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS ANDTHE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TOESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND,SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONEOF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THEARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . " GARGANTUANSTOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANEDAWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD AFRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO ATHREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BYEISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENTAS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HEPROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATOCOMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANKBILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DEFRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF AHANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IVJETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS .THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DEFRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUTOF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANESCAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HISNUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILESOF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH ANDMURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, ITIS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST,GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY ASCAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG .BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THISBAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND2) HAS " SPECIAL TIES " WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DEGAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKETWAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUSFREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BYWASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOTBE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950,LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITYAND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THEFOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKETGOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAGRIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITHAUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THERUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'SCONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAINPENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKEDFOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED INDECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED INBRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD ./ MATTER OF DAYS . " DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELSNEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOONMADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :.THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THECLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THETARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADEWITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIGAND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'SCHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HECONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : " IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYSBEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR .THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THEIMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATEDPRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE " INSULAR,MARITIME " BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO "EUROPEANS " BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEENSUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THATSECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DEGAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAMEJUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLANMEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S .WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THEBRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEARDETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH ASWELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHERPOWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TOWHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCEEXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TOSHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEARKNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE " TROJAN HORSE " FIRSTBEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OFBRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF ACITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH ANDBLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARDHEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCANSANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH AFINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MANDELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DEMURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOTBE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THEMEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING .NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THEFRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWDAND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THEELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT,WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OFBRITAIN, GRUNTED, " WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . " A FRENCHDELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, " IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ONA MISUNDERSTANDING . " ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHNTUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTEWARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OFA BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEARTHE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BYPOSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED,AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULDEVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM .MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNEDOF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WASADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION,TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLETO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATHTO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPAREDSTATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A "MONSTROUS THING ."DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILEGERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HADONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTIONTHAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST ITWAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED,HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLYBE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORETHAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  "IT IS BEING SAID THAT WEBROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS," HE DECLARED .  "IN REALITY, OURRESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVEBEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT ITIS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN .WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME,NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPONHER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEENA LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULDHAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKENCOUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITEDHIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  "IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED," HE SAID,"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS INEUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THEPAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT ."  ADDED HEATH :"THE TRUTH IS THATSOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS,THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF ."  WHEN HESTOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HANDALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THECOMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DEGAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT ATTHE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES,THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONALPRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEELLAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THEWORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGESTTRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THEU.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVERISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDINGWASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOSTASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALYAND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKETHE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED ISTHAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMONMARKET ("FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN," SAIDA SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKEEUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HENEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMONMARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLYDETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THEFIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMONMARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THEEXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESEDAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARDD'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELYDEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HADALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSOSHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'SASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL ANDGENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLERCOUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICALCOUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THECOMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKETAS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BEABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME .IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DEGAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWARTPARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDERWHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS ITHAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THETREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHENDE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS,ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THEREINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HEWAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONYIN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTOTHE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT,TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, "FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OFPUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY .DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NOLONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (ANDPOSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THEADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED INTHE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS INJEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THEBUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THEFRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OFPRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OFCHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THEU.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRMLOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATERWITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERALREPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROMWITHIN .SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATORRAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKEDLAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES "LONELY PLEASUREIN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES ." WHAT DISTURBS MANYAMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'SSTRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANYCONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OFTHEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TOCONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESSTO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS .DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOTIN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOINGBRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TOJOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE ANINVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THERESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WASTO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE "BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAINWOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET ." SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERESUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK,AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV,WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTSWITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITHRUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWOPOWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELYWITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLYPROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY .THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLETOLD AN AIDE, " NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNISTPUSH IN EUROPE . " THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE,AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, " REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKESIN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . " ACTS, NOT WORDS . INTALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THESITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST .HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERNEUROPE, THE GRADUAL " BOURGEOISATION " OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TOTURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES,WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEANARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, " STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THEURALS . " HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUTNEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANSMUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DEGAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENTCONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPSWOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THISMAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE .NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONEIN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENTAMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . " AND, HEARGUES, " IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TOTHE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE. " IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S .NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TOLAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGEDBRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIALQUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THEU.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINALWORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLESOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . " I WILL SAYONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE,BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . " INEFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGEDITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLEAT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP .IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SOSYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM,SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDYNOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE " COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THEFREE WORLD . " IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, " THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HEIS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEVERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . " THESUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCEAND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY. . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE INWHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONEOF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OFCONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OFSCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED INRETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?
