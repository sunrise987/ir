MULTI-BAFFLEMENT THE U.S .TODAY IS ENGAGED IN NOT ONE, BUT TWO NUCLEAR ARMS RACES . ITS FIRST ANDOVERRIDING CONCERN, OF COURSE, IS TO DETER SOVIET AGGRESSION AND TO BECAPABLE OF MASSIVE RETALIATION IF THE RUSSIANS SHOULD ATTACK THE WEST .WASHINGTON'S SECOND AIM, HOWEVER, IS LESS STRATEGIC THAN POLITICAL ;IT COULD BE CALLED THE THEORY OF THE MASSIVE PLACEBO, SINCE ITS PRIMARYPURPOSE IS NOT TO DETER THE FOES OF THE U.S . BUT TO MOLLIFY ITSFRIENDS AND DISCOURAGE THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR ARMS . BY LASTWEEK, U.S . PLACEBO PLANNERS HAD SUCCEEDED ONLY IN FRUSTRATING ANDPERPLEXING THE VERY ALLIES THEY HOPED TO PLEASE . UNEASILY AWARE THATTHE INCREASINGLY PROSPEROUS AND POWERFUL NATIONS OF WESTERN EUROPEWOULD NOT FOREVER ACCEPT TOTAL U.S . CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEU.S . OFFERED MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO TO GIVE THEM A VOICE IN THEIRDISPOSITION AND USE BUT LEFT IT TO EUROPE TO DEVISE A FORMULA . IT WASNOT UNTIL THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION CANCELED THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLTMISSILE PROJECT LAST DECEMBER THAT THE U.S . WAS FORCED TO TAKE THEINITIATIVE . IN PLACE OF SKYBOLT, THE ADMINISTRATION RELUCTANTLYOFFERED AT NASSAU TO SUPPLY POLARIS MISSILES FOR AN INDEPENDENT BRITISHSUBMARINE FORCE . CHANGE OF MIND . AT THE SAME TIME, THE U.S . INSISTEDTHAT THE BRITISH SUBS MUST BE " MULTINATIONAL, " THAT IS, THEY WERE TOBE PART OF A NATO DETERRENT IN WHICH OTHER ALLIES MIGHT IN TIME POOLTHEIR OWN STRIKE FORCES, IF AND WHEN THEY ACQUIRED NUCLEAR WEAPONS . TOPLACATE ITS OTHER EUROPEAN ALLIES, THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION ALSOPROPOSED A " MULTILATERAL " FORCE OF POLARIS SUBMARINES, WHICH WOULD BEMULTIMANNED AND MULTIFINANCED BY THE U.S . AND ITS PARTNERS, EACH OFWHOM WOULD HAVE A VETO OVER THE USE OF THE MISSILES . THEN, JUST AS THEEUROPEANS BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN THIS SCHEME, THE U.S . ABRUPTLYCHANGED ITS MIND AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE MULTILATERAL FORCE (MLF) SHOULDCONSIST OF POLARIS-ARMED SURFACE VESSELS INSTEAD THOUGH IT WOULD BELITTLE STRATEGIC VALUE, A 25-SHIP SURFACE FORCE WOULD COST ONLY $500MILLION YEARLY, FAR LESS THAN A SUBMARINE FLEET . TO MOST EUROPEANS,THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT FOR THE MLF WAS THAT IT WOULD GIVE WEST GERMANYA VOICE IN NUCLEAR STRATEGY AND POSSIBLY DISCOURAGE IT FROM DEVELOPINGNUCLEAR WEAPONS OF ITS OWN, WITH OR WITHOUT HELP FROM FRANCE FRANKLYINTERESTED . TO PEDDLE THE PLACEBO, THE ADMINISTRATION PLUCKED OLDSTATE DEPARTMENT HAND LIVINGSTON MERCHANT FROM RETIREMENT . TO HISSURPRISE, MLF MET WITH A SURPRISINGLY WARM RECEPTION . THOUGH SOMEALLIED STATESMEN HEMMED THAT ITS COST WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM MEETINGU.S . REQUESTS TO STRENGTHEN CONVENTIONAL FORCES, WEST GERMANY, ITALYAND BELGIUM WERE FRANKLY INTERESTED . LAST MONTH MERCHANT ACTUALLYSUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING A COMMITMENT FROM WEST GERMANY TO PAY 40 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE COST OF THE PROJECT . HOWEVER, LAST WEEK, WORDREACHED NATO HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS THAT WASHINGTON HAD SUDDENLY LOSTITS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE MULTILATERAL FORCE . ITS CHANGE OF MIND NOT ONLYLEFT UNSOLVED THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS THAT MLF WAS DEVISED TO SOLVE, BUTEVEN SEEMED LIKELY TO AGGRAVATE THEM, SINCE THE U.S . WAS NOWREPORTEDLY READY TO BACK THE IDEA OF INDEPENDENT MULTINATIONAL FORCESINSTEAD, THUS ENCOURAGING ITS ALLIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN BOMBS . EVEN IFEVERY NATO ALLY COULD AFFORD ITS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE AND A SCIENTIFICBREAKTHROUGH MAY YET MAKE THAT FEASIBLE EUROPE WOULD HAVE ONLY A MINUTEPROPORTION OF THE TOTAL U.S . NUCLEAR ARMORY . BUT WHO CAN PREDICT HOWIT WILL TURN OUT ? IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF BUILD-YOUR-OWN-BANG, ITCOULD EVEN HAPPEN THAT EUROPEAN HYDROGEN BOMBS MIGHT NOT FALL ON THESOVIET UNION AT ALL, BUT ON THE U.S .
