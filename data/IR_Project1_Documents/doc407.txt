IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD, THAILAND'S PREMIER SARITTHANARAT WAS A MAN . A BLUFF, HARD-WENCHING, HARD-DRINKING SOLDIER,SARIT WAS ALSO A MASTERLY PRO-WESTERN POLITICIAN WHO STABILIZEDTHAILAND'S CHAOTIC GOVERNMENT AND SAGGING ECONOMY, ROOTED OUT OFFICIALCORRUPTION AND CRACKED DOWN HARD ON COMMUNIST INFILTRATION . IN THE "DOMINO " VIEW OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE COLLAPSE OF ONECOUNTRY COULD KNOCK OVER ALL THE OTHERS, THAILAND ALONE STOOD FIRM,SURROUNDED BY TOTTERING NEIGHBORS LAOS, CAMBODIA, VIET NAM, BURMA .WHEN SARIT DIED LAST WEEK AT 55, THE U.S . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVEYEARS WAS FORCED TO WORRY WHETHER THAILAND WOULD BECOME ANOTHER OFSOUTHEAST ASIA'S WAVERING DOMINOES . TRICK ACHIEVED . THOUGH MARSHALSARIT RULED THAILAND AS AN ABSOLUTE DICTATOR, HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OFRESPONSIBILITY TOWARD COUNTRY AND PEOPLE . " ANYBODY CAN STAGE AREVOLUTION, " HE SAID AFTER SEIZING POWER IN A BLOODLESS COUP IN 1957 ./ THE TRICK, ONCE THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN STAGED, IS WINNING PUBLICAPPROVAL . " ON DOCTOR'S ORDERS, HE WENT ON THE WAGON, BEGANHOUSECLEANING THAILAND FROM TOP TO BOTTOM . HE BANNED OPIUM SMOKING,AND WHEN A RASH OF FIRES BROKE OUT IN BANGKOK'S BUSINESS DISTRICT ONEWINTER, HE ORDERED FOUR CHINESE MERCHANTS SHOT A BRUTAL BUT EFFECTIVEREMINDER THAT THE ANNUAL CUSTOM OF BURNING SHOPS TO COLLECT INSURANCEFOR THE CHINESE NEW YEAR WAS NOW TABOO . SARIT SLASHED THE PRICE OFRICE, TRANSPORTATION AND SCHOOL FEES, ALLOCATED AS MUCH MONEY FOREDUCATION AS FOR DEFENSE . HE ENCOURAGED FOREIGN INVESTMENT ANDINDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, HAD MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGERESERVES SOCKED AWAY, SPURRED A HEALTHY 6 PER CENT ANNUAL RISE IN THEG.N.P . WHEN COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS STEPPED UP THEIR CAMPAIGN OFSUBVERSION IN THE SCRUBBY, IMPOVERISHED NORTHEAST PROVINCES, SARIT SETIN MOTION A CRASH $300 MILLION PROGRAM OF MEDICAL, ECONOMIC ANDEDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT UNDERCUT THE RED THREAT . THOUGH HIS RULEWAS ABSOLUTE, HE ALWAYS KNELT BEFORE THAILAND'S KING BHUMIBOLADULYADEJ, ENCOURAGED THAIS TO ACCEPT THE KING AS HEAD OF STATE ANDSYMBOL OF NATIONAL UNITY . THREE WEEKS AGO, SARIT WENT TO THE HOSPITALWITH COMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER AND A LIFETIMEOF HARD LIVING . AMONG HIS OTHER AILMENTS : ENLARGEMENT OF THE HEART,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, KIDNEY DISEASE, CONGESTED LUNGS . FROM HISHOSPITAL BED, HE SANG TO HIS WIFE AN OLD THAI BALLAD THAT BEGINS : /THE LOVE OF 100 MISTRESSES COULD NOT BE COMPARED TO THE LOVE ONE HASFOR HIS OWN WIFE.' ? THE U.S . ARMY SURGEON GENERAL RUSHED TO BANGKOKTO TREAT SARIT, BUT HIS HEART FINALLY GAVE OUT . THE JOB AHEAD .SARIT'S DEATH OCCASIONED NATIONAL MOURNING AND HONORS USUALLY ACCORDEDONLY TO THAILAND'S ROYAL FAMILY . DRESSED IN A FIELD MARSHAL'S UNIFORM,SARIT'S BODY WAS PLACED ON A BIER IN BANGKOK ON THE GROUNDS OF THEMARBLE TEMPLE . THOUSANDS OF MOURNERS POURED SCENTED WATER FROM CONCHSHELLS OVER THE CORPSE'S EXTENDED RIGHT HAND AS A GESTURE OF FAREWELLAND AS A PLEA FOR FORGIVENESS FOR ANY GRIEVANCE COMMITTED AGAINST THEDEAD MAN . THEN THE BODY, FOLDED IN A FETAL POSITION, WAS PUT IN ANORNATE GOLDEN URN, WHERE IT WILL REMAIN UNTIL IT IS CREMATED, PROBABLYSOME TIME IN THE EARLY SPRING . SARIT'S SUCCESSOR IS FORMER VICEPREMIER AND DEFENSE MINISTER THANOM KITTIKACHORN, 52, A HANDSOME,AMIABLE ARMY GENERAL WHO SERVED UNIMPRESSIVELY AS PREMIER IN 1958 WHENSARIT WAS LAID UP IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL . THANOM WAS A CLOSE FRIENDOF SARIT'S AND A LOYAL SUPPORTER OF HIS POLICIES ; HE IMMEDIATELYAPPOINTED A NEW CABINET ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS HIS PREDECESSOR'S,PROMISED TO FOLLOW SARIT'S PRO-WESTERN, ANTI-COMMUNIST POLICIES . MOSTIN HIS FAVOR : HE INHERITS A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE ARMYPROVIDES POWER, THE TOPFLIGHT CIVIL SERVICE CONTRIBUTES ADMINISTRATIVEABILITY, AND THE MONARCHY LENDS LEGITIMACY TO THE WHOLE . BUTREMEMBERING THAILAND'S SHAKY, PRE-SARIT PAST, IN WHICH COUP FOLLOWEDCOUP, THAILAND'S MOST SOPHISTICATED LEADERS KNOW THAT THIS SYSTEM WILLHAVE TO WITHSTAND A STRONG DRIFT BACK TO THE OLD PATTERN . THE THAINATION FACES " A TREMENDOUS TASK, " SAYS ABLE FOREIGN MINISTER THANATKHOMAN . " IT IS, AS YOU SAY IN AMERICA, A HELL OF A JOB . /
