RED CHINA WHO NEEDS PANTS ? PEKING LAST WEEK PUBLICLYADMITTED THAT RED CHINA WILL NOT HAVE ITS LONGPROMISED NUCLEAR BOMB FORA LONG TIME TO COME . FOREIGN MINISTER MARSHAL CHEN YI CONCEDED THATECONOMIC TROUBLES AND THE QUARREL WITH THE RUSSIANS (WHO WITHDREW THEIRTECHNICIANS AND BROKE AN ATOMIC-AID TREATY) HAVE SERIOUSLY DELAYEDPEKING'S ATOMIC PROGRAM . IT WOULD BE " SEVERAL YEARS, " CHEN TOLDVISITING JAPANESE CORRESPONDENTS, BEFORE THE REGIME COULD EVEN TEST ACRUDE ATOM BOMB . BUT CHINA IS FAR FROM GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. SOME TIME AGO, KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THAT ANY COUNTRY TRYING TO BUILD ABOMB WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES MIGHT LOSE ITS PANTS . NEVERTHELESS,SAID CHEN, SOUNDING LIKE AN ECHO OF CHARLES DE GAULLE, " AT THE RISK OFLOSING OUR PANTS, WE ARE DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD AND BUILD OUR OWNATOMIC BOMBS . OTHERWISE WE WILL END UP AS A SECOND- OR THIRD-CLASSNATION .
