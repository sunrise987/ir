COMMUNISTS       THE SPHINX ANYONE?  THE MOST RELUCTANTRUBBERNECK IN EGYPT LAST WEEK WAS COMMUNIST CHINA'S PREMIER CHOUEN-LAI . GRANTED ONLY THREE SESSIONS WITH PRESIDENT NASSER DURINGHIS WEEK'S SOJOURN IN CAIRO, CHOU WAS PROPELLED RELENTLESSLYTHROUGH THE LIST OF VIP TOURIST ATTRACTIONS:  AN AUTOMOBILE PLANT,A MUSEUM, EGYPT'S MILITARY ACADEMY, THE ASWAN DAM . WHEN HISHOSTS INSISTED ON A CLOSE-UP INSPECTION OF THE SPHINX, CHOU ASKEDPLAINTIVELY:  "DO I HAVE TO GO?  I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT FROM ADISTANCE ." THOUGH THE VISIT TO EGYPT WAS ONLY THE FIRST LEG OF HISSCHEDULED TWO-MONTH SWING THROUGH AFRICA, THE ROUND OF SIGHTSEEINGCLEARLY TIRED THE AILING, 67-YEAR-OLD CHOU . FOR THE FIRST TIME,WESTERNERS NOTICED THAT HE HAS ONLY PARTIAL USE OF HIS RIGHT ARM,WHICH WAS USUALLY CLUTCHED TIGHTLY OVER HIS STOMACH . AT ONE POINT,AFTER CLIMBING A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AT AN ASWAN POWER STATION, THEASHEN-FACED PREMIER STAGGERED OFF INTO A CORNER AS IF HE WERE ABOUTTO FAINT . ONE OF TWO DOCTORS IN HIS ENTOURAGE HURRIED OVER ANDAPPEARED TO GIVE HIM A WHIFF OF SMELLING SALTS . AS CHOU RAISED HISHEAD, BLOOD TRICKLED FROM HIS NOSE . "IT HAPPENS WHENEVER HE GETSTIRED," SHRUGGED ONE OF HIS AIDES . "IT IS NOT SERIOUS, BUT THATIS WHY HE ALWAYS HAS A DOCTOR WITH HIM ." CHOU NONETHELESS HADPLENTY OF ENERGY FOR SPEECHMAKING, HARPED REPEATEDLY ON THE PEKINGVERSION OF MOSCOW'S WE-WILL-BURY-YOU REFRAIN . INDEED, TOHEAR CHOU, THE AFRO-ASIANS WILL BURY NOT ONLY THE WEST, BUT RUSSIA ASWELL . "THE ASIAN AND AFRICAN PEOPLES," HE PROCLAIMED, "THROUGHTHEIR LABOR AND INTELLECT CREATED ILLUSTRIOUS CIVILIZATIONS WHICH WEREDEMOLISHED BY IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION AND TYRANNY . NOW THAT WE HAVEBROKEN THE IMPERIALISTIC SHACKLES, WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK NEWMIRACLES ." FOR ALL HIS EAGERNESS TO WIN AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR PEKING'SSIDE IN THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT, HOWEVER, CHOU COULD OFFER LITTLECASH TO THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES . IN SOME AREAS THAT THECHINESE HAVE CULTIVATED, THEY MAY EVEN END BY MAKING MOREENEMIES THAN FRIENDS . BY LENDING SOMALIA $20 MILLION TO BUY ARMS FORITS CAMPAIGN TO GRAB ADJACENT TERRITORY, PEKING HAS ANGERED NEIGHBORINGKENYA, WHERE IT HAS ALSO SPENT HEAVILY TO WOO THE NEW NATION . IT MAYSUCCEED AT LEAST IN RAISING RUSSIA'S ANTE IN AFRICA AND ASIA . ATWEEK'S END, AS CHOU LEFT FOR ALGERIA, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV WASREPORTEDLY PLANNING HIS OWN SWING THROUGH AFRICA . BEFOREVISITING CAIRO NEXT SPRING, HE MAY ALSO JUNKET TO INDIA ANDNEPAL ON CHOU'S BACK DOORSTEP . THEN IT WILL BE NIKITA'S TURNTO TELL WHO WILL BURY WHOM .
