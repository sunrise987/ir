VERY FEW FRENCHMEN HAD MUCH SYMPATHY FORTHE DEFENDANTS, BUT MANY HAD GRAVE DOUBTS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE BEINGTRIED . DE GAULLE'S CHOSEN INSTRUMENT FOR THE TRIAL WAS THE SPECIALCOURT OF MILITARY JUSTICE, FROM WHOSE VERDICT THERE IS NO APPEAL, WHICHWAS SET UP LAST YEAR AND WAS TO END ITS EXISTENCE ON FEB . 25 . THEDEFENDANTS' ATTORNEYS SHREWDLY TRIED TO DELAY PROCEEDINGS UNTIL THATDATE SO THAT THE CASE WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN IN A REGULARCOURT, FROM WHICH APPEALS COULD BE TAKEN .

ALL NONSENSE . THOUGH REFUSING TORECOGNIZE THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT, BASTIEN-THIRY AGREED TO ANSWERQUESTIONS, " BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE FRENCH PEOPLE TO KNOW WHYWE HAVE ACTED AND HOW WE HAVE ACTED . " HIS STORY WAS FANTASTIC,INCREDIBLE, AND THOROUGHLY FRENCH . TO BEGIN WITH, EXPLAINEDBASTIEN-THIRY, THE AMBUSH HAD NOT BEEN INTENDED TO KILL DE GAULLE, ONLYTO CAPTURE HIM . TO THIS END, THE ASSASSINS WHO WERE ALL " CRACK SHOTS/ HAD FIRED AT THE TIRES OF DE GAULLE'S CAR .

WITH DEGAULLE DISPOSED OF, THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE RESISTANCE PLANNED TOAPPOINT A NEW HEAD OF STATE : NONE OTHER THAN DE GAULLE'S PRESENTFINANCE MINISTER VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING . GISCARD D'ESTAING SAID ITWAS ALL NONSENSE, THAT HE HAD NEVER EVEN MET BASTIEN-THIRY AND HAD NOLINKS WITH EITHER THE SECRET ARMY OR THE COUNCIL OF THE RESISTANCE .THE WILD RHETORIC OF THE DEFENDANTS COULD NOT CONCEAL THE IMPLACABLEDETERMINATION TO KILL . LA GLOIRE SUMMONS FRENCHMEN IN MANY DIRECTIONS.
