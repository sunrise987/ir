CONGO BRIDGING THE PAST PRINCIPAL ARTERY OF COMMERCE IN THECONGO WAS TRADITIONALLY THE CONGOLESE NATIONAL ROUTE, A 1,725-MILERAIL-RIVERRAIL CONNECTION FROM ELISABETHVILLE IN KATANGA TO THEATLANTIC GATEWAY AT MATADI . BUT THE ROUTE BECAME UNUSABLE WITH THEOUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR . WHENEVER KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBEFELT EVENTS GOING AGAINST HIM, HE QUICKLY ORDERED ANOTHER RAILROADBRIDGE BLOWN UP . THUS, SINCE 1960 MOST TRAFFIC HAS MOVED ON ALTERNATERAIL LINES THROUGH PORTUGUESE ANGOLA AND MOZAMBIQUE . BUT THE ROUTESACROSS FOREIGN TERRITORY SOAK UP REVENUE BADLY NEEDED WITHIN THE CONGO,AND LAST WEEK PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA HOPEFULLY DEDICATED A NEW RAILROADBRIDGE AT BUKAMA, THE FINAL REBUILT LINK IN THE KATANGA-MATADI RUN . "THIS IS NOT ONLY A BRIDGE OVER THE LUALABA RIVER, " SAID ADOULA . " ITIS A BRIDGE OVER THE UNHAPPY PAST . " THOUGH A MILESTONE OF SORTS, THEBUKAMA BRIDGE ALSO MARKS THE PETTY PACE OF CONGOLESE UNITY, FOR THESTEAMY 25-DAY TRIP BY BARGE AND BOXCAR REMAINS AN AWESOME OBSTACLECOURSE . SOME OF THE 23 CONGOLESE PROVINCES CREATED SINCE 1962 CLAIMAUTHORITY TO LEVY IMPORT-EXPORT DUTIES AS THE MOOD STRIKES THEM . ALSO,TRIBAL TENSIONS NECESSITATE FREQUENT CHANGES OF ENGINEERS AS TRAINSPASS FROM ONE REGION TO THE NEXT . IF THE LOCAL FOLK SPOT AN ENEMY ATTHE CONTROLS, THEY MIGHT SWARM ABOARD AND KILL HIM ON THE SPOT .
