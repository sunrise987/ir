SOUTH VIET NAM BACK TOSAIGON THIS WEEK, FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THREE MONTHS, GOES U.S .DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT S . MCNAMARA . HIS AIM : TO SIZE UP SOUTHVIET NAM'S NEW REGIME, WHICH WAS HELPED TO POWER BY THE U.S . ON THETHEORY THAT IT WOULD FIGHT THE WAR MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE MURDEREDPRESIDENT DIEM, BUT WHICH, SO FAR AT LEAST, HAS PROVIDED DISAPPOINTINGLEEDERSHIP . THE WAR IS STILL SHOWING ALARMING DRIFT, AND THE COMMUNISTGUERRILLAS HAVE SHOWN SIGNS OF GETTING BOLDER . LAST WEEK TIMECORRESPONDENT MURRAY GART, TO GET HIS OWN LOOK AT THE WAR, FLEW ON 26HELICOPTER MISSIONS IN FIVE DAYS (THREE OF HIS CHOPPERS WERE HIT BYGUNFIRE), CAME AWAY WITH THE STORY OF A PLAN FOR STEPPED-UP AERIALSTRIKES AGAINST THE REDS AND SOME GRIM IMPRESSIONS OF THE FIGHTING INGENERAL . GART'S REPORT : AT SAIGONAIRPORT BEFORE DAWN, A SWARM OF HELICOPTERS SPUTTERED TO LIFE, THEIRWHIRLING BLADES CHURNING UP MISTY CONTRAILS IN THE COOL, DAMP AIR .SOON A FORMATION OF 13 " HUEYS " (UH-1BS) WAS AIRBORNE AND DRONING AWAYAT 2,000 FT . BELOW, THE LIGHT OF DAY BROKE OVER THE MEKONG DELTA,TURNING RIVERS AND CANALS INTO SILVERY RIBBONS AMONG THE GREENPADDYFIELDS . INSIDE THE CHOPPERS, MEN LONG HARDENED TO POSSIBLE DEATHCAREFULLY CRUSHED OUT THEIR AFTER-BREAKFAST CIGARETTES . A MERE FIFTEENMINUTES OUT OF SAIGON AND DIRECTLY SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL, THE THREE LEADHUEYS, BRISTLING WITH ROCKETS AND MACHINE GUNS, BUZZED THE TARGET AREA; THEY HEDGE-HOPPED LINES OF FOLIAGE, HOVERED OVER HUTS, SCRUTINIZEDTHE PADDY FIELDS . " NEGATIVE CONTACT, " U.S . PILOT CAPTAIN DENNISBOYLE RADIOED TO THE MAIN FORCE, MEANING NO GROUND FIRE . THE REST OFTHE FLEET FLUTTERED INTO THE ZONE, AND WHILE ARMED CRAFT CIRCLEDPROTECTIVELY, FIVE " SKINNED " (UNARMED) HUEYS ALIGHTED IN A CLEARINGAND DISGORGED 70 VIETNAMESE TROOPS . THE SOLDIERS SWEPT THROUGH AVILLAGE, ROUNDING UP PEASANTS SUSPECTED OF BEING GUERRILLAS ; SOME OFTHE MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CROUCHING TOGETHER, UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THEYWERE NOT OUT IN THE FIELDS WORKING . ONE OFFERED A SOLDIER 1,000PIASTERS ($13.60) TO SET HIM FREE ; THE SOLDIER GLADLY ACCEPTED THEPAYOFF, THEN TAGGED THE CAPTIVE WITH A WHITE SCARF IDENTIFYING HIM AS APROBABLE VIET CONG . SHIRTS WERE STRIPPED FROM BACKS TO CHECK FOR THEGUERRILLA'S TELLTALE MARKS OF PACK STRAPS . FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER,THE HELICOPTERS WERE HEADED BACK TO SAIGON WITH A HAUL OF 14 PRISONERS. REPLACING TERROR . THE OPERATION, CALLED AN " EAGLE STRIKE,/ IS A TACTIC BY WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND ITS U.S . ADVISERS HOPETO ADD SPEED AND INITIATIVE TO ANTI-GUERRILLA OPERATIONS . THOUGH SUCHSTRIKES HAVE LONG BEEN USED IN VIET NAM FOR MISSIONS BIG AND SMALL, THEPROGRAM NOW BEING LAUNCHED AIMS TO CARRY OUT SMALLSCALE,SEARCH-AND-SEIZE MISSIONS AS NEVER BEFORE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HEAVILYINFILTRATED DELTA . FOR THE FIRST TIME THE U.S . UTILITY TACTICALTRANSPORT COMPANY BASED AT SAIGON AIRPORT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED " EAGLESTRIKES " AS A PERMANENT DUTY . A U.S . MAJOR DESCRIBES THE OPERATIONAS " A RECONNAISSANCE FORCE ALWAYS SEEKING OUT THE ENEMY, STRIKING ONLYWHEN CONTACT IS MADE OR INTELLIGENCE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE A LANDINGWORTHWHILE . ALSO, IT IS CARRIED OUT BY A SMALL FORCE, NOT ONE THATREQUIRES THE MOVEMENT OF DOZENS OF CRAFT AND BATTALIONS OF MEN . "BRIGADIER GENERAL JOSEPH W . STILWELL JR., " VINEGAR JOE'S " SON, WHO "FLIES " A DESK IN SAIGON BUT WHO IS ALWAYS SLIPPING OUT ON CHOPPERMISSIONS, PUTS THE TACTICAL CHALLENGE IN SOUTH VIET NAM IN BRUTALLYFRANK TERMS . " THE PROBLEM, " SAYS HE, " IS TO REPLACE VIET CONGCONTROL OF THE COUNTRYSIDE, WHICH THEY MAINTAIN THROUGH MURDER, RAPE,TORTURE AND TERROR, WITH SOMETHING ELSE . WE DON'T USE TERROR TACTICS .THE EAGLE STRIKE IS THE BEST WAY TO GO AFTER THEM, USING THE ELEMENT OFCOMPLETE SURPRISE . BUT IT IS ONLY ONE WAY, AND WE NEED OTHERS . "AFTER COMPLETING THEIR CRACK-OF-DAWN MISSION LAST WEEK THE CREWS OF THE13 HUEYS AND THE 70 VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS RESTED WHILE THEIR CHOPPERSWERE BEING REFUELED, THEN WERE AIRBORNE AGAIN, HEADING FOR AVILLAGE JUST TWELVE MILES SOUTH OF SAIGON . THIS TIME ONE HELICOPTER INTHE FIRST WAVE TOOK A BULLET IN THE FUSELAGE, BUT THE TROOP CARRIERSSET DOWN ANYWAY . THE SOLDIERS FOUND THE VILLAGE FLYING A VIET CONGFLAG, ROUNDED UP 43 PRISONERS . BACK AT THE BASE (BY NOW IT WAS NOON),THE EAGLES RECEIVED A REPORT THAT A VIET CONG COMPANY HAD BEEN SPOTTEDMOVING TEN MILES SOUTH OF SAIGON AND SCRAMBLED ONCE MORE . OVER THETHEY RAN INTO MACHINE-GUN FIRE, BUT SILENCED IT WITH A FUSILLADE OFROCKETS AND BULLETS THE VIETNAMESE LANDED AND ROUNDED UP WHATEVER REDSHAD NOT MANAGED TO ESCAPE . PRIVATE YALU . THE HELICOPTERWORK REQUIRES STEADY NERVES . ONE ARMED HUEY ESCORTING A SUPPLY CHOPPERAT AN OUTPOST ON THE PLAIN OF REEDS WEST OF SAIGON ATTACKED AMACHINEGUN NEST THAT HAD OPENED FIRE . JUST BEFORE ONE ROCKET WASDROPPED, IT WAS APPARENTLY STRUCK BY A SNIPER'S BULLET AND BLEW UP,SHATTERING THE PLANE'S PLEXIGLAS WINDOWS ; THE GUNNER AND THE CREWCHIEF SUFFERED SUPERFICIAL BUT BLOODY FACE WOUNDS . THE DIALOGUE OVERTHE INTERCOM BETRAYED NO PANIC : " WAS A ROCKET BLEW UP, WASN'T IT ?/ IT WAS SOMETHIN' . " / YOU O.K., O'SHEA .Q? " / ROGER . " / ANYBODYELSE GET HIT ? " / YOU GOT A FAT LIP THERE, BOY . " DURING ANOTHERMISSION, AN AERIAL ATTACK ON TWO COMPANIES OF VIET CONG DUG INTOFOXHOLES HEAR THE DIFFICULT-TO-PATROL CAMBODIAN BORDER, SOME OF THEGROUND FIRE CAME FROM ACROSS A RIVER THAT SEPARATES VIET NAM FROM "NEUTRAL " CAMBODIA A RIVER THAT ONE AMERICAN ADVISER BITTERLY CALLS "OUR OWN PRIVATE YALU . " DISMAL SCENE . DESPITE THE ATTEMPTAT IMPROVED MOBILITY, SOUTH VIET NAM'S GENERALS HAVE YET TO STAGE ANYSPECTACULAR FEATS AGAINST THE VIET CONG ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE PLANS ON THEDRAWING BOARDS, AND GOVERNMENT FORCES LAST WEEK CAPTURED MORE WEAPONSTHAN THEY LOST FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS . EVERYWHERE ONE TRAVELS,AND THE ONLY SAFE MODE OF TRAVEL IS BY HELICOPTER, THE COUNTRYSIDE IS ADISMAL SIGHT OF ACTUAL OR THREATENED VIET CONG CONTROL . IN THE DELTATO THE SOUTH, AND IN TWO OR THREE PROVINCES AROUND SAIGON, THERE IS NODOUBT OF WHO CONTROLS THE BOONDOCKS . OF MOUNTING CONCERN IS THECOMMUNISTS' INCREASED HOLD ON VITAL LONG AN PROVINCE ON SAIGON'SSOUTHERN FLANK, WHERE CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME PRECARIOUS . A U.S .ADVISER SAYS WRYLY THAT THERE IS NO NEED IN LONG AN FOR THEGOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO ABOLISH SOME OF THE OVEREXTENDED OUTPOSTS . " THEVIET CONG, " HE SAYS, " ARE DOING THAT FOR US . " IN A GUERRILLA WAR,IT IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHO IS WINNING . BUT IN VIET NAM SOMETHINGS DO SEEM CERTAIN : MANY MORE LIVES WILL BE TRAGICALLY LOST, THEWAR CANNOT POSSIBLY BE WON BY 1965, AND A RICH JEWEL OF A COUNTRYCARVED OUT OF ANCIENT INDOCHINA SEES NO END IN SIGHT TO A DECADE OFRED-INSTIGATED FIGHTING . ABOUT THE BEST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IS TOMAINTAIN HOPE, APPLY MUSCLE IN THE RIGHT PLACES, MAKE LONG-RANGECOMMITMENTS, AND RETAIN A DOGGED DETERMINATION TO KEEP FIGHTING . THENMAYBE, JUST MAYBE, EVENTS AND THE TIDE OF BATTLE WILL MERGE TO KEEPTHIS PIECE OF REAL ESTATE FROM COMMUNIST CONTROL .
