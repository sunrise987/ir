SOUTH AFRICA WHOSE COUNTRY ? FOR A NATION DEDICATED TO WHITESUPREMACY, THE VOTING IN SOUTH AFRICA LAST WEEK HAD AN UNACCUSTOMEDLOOK . BLACK WOMEN WITH RED-OCHERED FACES FUMBLED WITH CUMBERSOME2-FT.-SQ . BALLOTS . THEIR MEN, LOOKING A LITTLE BAFFLED BY THE WHOLEBUSINESS, STREAMED UP TO REGISTER THEIR VOTES FOR A TRANSKEI PARLIAMENT. IT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN PRIME MINISTER HENDRIK VERWOERD'S PLAN TO "SOLVE " SOUTH AFRICA'S RACE PROBLEM : THE FORMATION OF BLACK "SELF-GOVERNING " REGIONS CALLED BANTUSTANS, WHERE ALL OF SOUTH AFRICA'S11 MILLION NATIVES, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MILLION NEEDED AS LABOR FOR THEWHITES, ARE TO BE HERDED INTO REMOTE AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVATIONS .TRANSKEI, WHERE THE FIRST BANTUSTAN LEGISLATURE WAS BEING DRAWN, IS ADENMARK-SIZED PLOT OF ROLLING LAND ALONG THE INDIAN OCEAN COAST, WHICHFOR YEARS HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY THE WHITES . IT IS FARM LAND THATTHROUGH BANTU OVERPOPULATION HAS BEEN VICTIM OF OVERGRAZING AND EROSION. WITHOUT HEAVY CAPITAL INVESTMENT, IT CANNOT SUPPORT MANY ADDITIONALPEOPLE . SINCE THE GOLD MINES AND INDUSTRY OF THE WHITE MAN'S ORANGEFREE STATE AND TRANSVAAL ARE FAR MORE ALLURING, THERE IS PRECIOUSLITTLE CHANCE OF ANYONE'S INVESTING ANYTHING MUCH IN THE BANTU'SBOONDOCKS . PREPARING THE ELECTION IN THIS UNPROMISING REGION (SEVENOTHER SIMILAR RESERVATIONS ARE PLANNED), VERWOERD'S POLICE FLOCKED INTOTHE TRANSKEI TO SET UP SENTINELS AT EACH OF 1,100 POLLING STATIONS .AND TO THE ILLITERATE ELECTORATE, WORD HAD ALREADY GONE OUT ABOUT WHICHCANDIDATES THE GOVERNMENT FAVORED . IRONICALLY, VERWOERD'S CHOICE WAS ABLACK RACIST NAMED KAIZER MATANZIMA, 48, A SUAVE, HANDSOME ATTORNEY,WHO SAYS : " ALL THE WHITES MUST LEAVE THE TRANSKEI . THIS IS OURCOUNTRY . " HIS OPPONENT : WISE, WIZENED PARAMOUNT CHIEF VICTOR POTO,65, WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THE TRANSKEI'S SMALL (16,000) WHITECOMMUNITY FORCED OUT, WANTS TO SET UP A MULTIRACIAL REGIME : " I AMGRATEFUL TO GOD FOR A CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE HUMANRACE . " IN ANY CASE, VERWOERD'S WIDELY ADVERTISED SELF-RULE FOR THENATIVE REGIONS IS LARGELY HOLLOW, SINCE HIS GOVERNMENT WILL RETAINCONTROL OVER THE POLICE, DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS . ALL LEGISLATIONPROPOSED BY THE TRANSKEI'S NEW ALL-BLACK ASSEMBLY WILL FIRST RUN THEGAUNTLET OF NUMEROUS TAME, GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED CHIEFS, AND AFTER THATIS SUBJECT TO THE VETO OF VERWOERD'S OWN OFFICIALS .
