GREAT BRITAIN ALDERMASTON'S AMEN ? SINCE 1958, WHEN THECAMPAIGN FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT STAGED THE FIRST ALDERMASTON MARCH,ITS 52-MILE EASTER PARADE HAS TURNED INTO BRITAIN'S BIGGEST LUNATICFRINGE BENEFIT . BEARDIES AND WEIRDIES SOON STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT FROMTHE PACIFIST PARSONS AND LEFT-WING LABORITES WHO STARTED THEBAN-THE-BOMB MOVEMENT . IT ALSO BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE FOUR-DAYSHUFFLE WAS BEING MANIPULATED BY SUCH HIGHLY MOTIVATED " PILGRIMS " ASCOMMUNIST AGITATORS, ANARCHISTS, AND A FEW THUGS TO BOOT . LAST WEEK,AFTER THE SIXTH ANNUAL SPECTACULAR ENDED IN BLISTERS AND BOMBAST INHYDE PARK, MOST RESPONSIBLE BRITONS INCLUDING SEVERAL C.N.D .CO-FOUNDERS WERE MORE EAGER TO BAN THE MARCH THAN THE BOMB . THEIRDISILLUSIONMENT WAS THE RESULT OF A STRATAGEM THAT STRUCK EVEN THETOLERANT BRITISH AS A DISLOYAL ACT . EVEN BEFORE THE MARCHERS LEFTALDERMASTON, THERE APPEARED COPIES OF A CRUDELY MIMEOGRAPHED,TWELVEPAGE DOCUMENT HEADED : DANGER ! OFFICIAL SECRET . INSIDE, ITSANONYMOUS AUTHORS DECLARED : " WE ARE SPIES FOR PEACE . WE HAVEDECIDED TO PUBLISH AN OFFICIAL SECRET . THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORESECRETS IN CAPTIVITY . THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WE SHALL RELEASE . "THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINED WAS, IN FACT, HIGHLY CLASSIFIED : THELOCATIONS, CODE NAMES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF TWELVE REGIONAL SEATS OFGOVERNMENT FROM WHICH BRITISH AUTHORITIES WOULD ATTEMPT TO RESTOREORDER IN THE EVENT OF NUCLEAR ATTACK . " THIS, " EXCLAIMED HOMESECRETARY HENRY BROOKE, " IS THE WORK OF A TRAITOR . " BY NOCOINCIDENCE, THE ONLY EMERGENCY HEADQUARTERS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL WASR.S.G . 6, AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER IN THE BERKSHIRE WOODS ALONG THEMARCHERS' ROUTE FROM READING TO LONDON . IGNORING C.N.D . OFFICIALS'PLEAS TO STAY ON THE MAIN ROAD, 1,000 OF SOME 15,000 MARCHERS LEFT THEPROCESSION AND POURED DOWN THE COUNTRY LANE MARKED ON THE " PEACE "SPIES' MAP . AFTER A SCUFFLE WITH POLICE, THE SHOUTING DEMONSTRATORSSTAGED A MASS SQUAT AROUND THE BUNKER FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, UNTIL ONEOF THEIR LEADERS ANNOUNCED : " WE HAVE ACHIEVED OUR OBJECT . "WHATEVER THEIR REAL OBJECT, THE " SPIES FOR PEACE " TRIGGERED AFULL-SCALE SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATION AND BROUGHT PRIME MINISTERHAROLD MACMILLAN SCURRYING BACK FROM HIS COUNTRY HOME TO LONDON FORCONSULTATION WITH HIS CABINET . NEVERTHELESS, CANON JOHN COLLINS, C.N.D. CHAIRMAN AND PRECEPTOR OF ST . PAUL'S CATHEDRAL, SIMPERED ON TV THATMOST MARCHERS " TREATED IT RATHER AS A JOKE . " HIS MERRIMENT WAS NOTSHARED BY JAMES CAMERON, A CRUSADING JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN APROMINENT FIGURE IN C.N.D . SINCE ITS INCEPTION . CAMERON CONCEDEDSADLY THAT THE BAN-THE-BOMB MARCHES HAD BECOME A VEHICLE FOR TOO MANYSECONDARY AND DUBIOUS INTENTIONS . " ADMITTING BELATEDLY THAT C.N.D .HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR A RIDE, CAMERON CRIED : " GOD SAVE US FROM OURFRIENDS .
