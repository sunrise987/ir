LAOS A NEW CIVIL WAR ? JUST NINE MONTHS AFTER THE14-NATION GENEVA CONFERENCE GUARANTEED LAOTIAN NEUTRALITY, LAOS LASTWEEK TOTTERED ON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR AND ONCE AGAIN THREATENED TODRAG THE MAJOR POWERS INTO A BITTER STRUGGLE . FOR THREE WEEKS, THE REDFORCES, REINFORCED BY CADRES OF VIET MINH TROOP COMMANDERS, MORTARSPECIALISTS AND ARTILLERY ADVISERS FROM COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM, HADBEEN NIBBLING AWAY AT NEUTRALIST POSITIONS AROUND THE 30-MILE PERIMETEROF THE GRASSY, POOL-TABLE-FLAT PLAINE DES JARRES . STRATEGICALLY PLACEDIN THE CENTER OF LAOS, THE PLAIN NAMED AFTER THE ANCIENT STONE BURIALJARS STILL FOUND IN THE AREA CONTROLS THE APPROACHES TO THE REST OF THECOUNTRY AND IS THE PRIMARY ACCESS ROUTE TO NORTH VIET NAM . WITH THEPLAINE DES JARRES IN THEIR HANDS, THE REDS COULD SOLIDIFY THEIR HOLD ONALL OF NORTHERN LAOS . LAST WEEK THIS GLOOMY PROSPECT WAS ALL BUT AFACT, AS 10,000 RED TROOPS POURED ONTO THE PLAIN, FORCING THENEUTRALISTS TO ITS VERY EDGE . CIGARETTES & BULLETS . THE WEEK BEGANWITH A DESPERATE FLIGHT TO THE PLAIN BY NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNAPHOUMA, WHO HOPED IT STILL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO ARRANGE A CEASE-FIREBETWEEN THE COMMUNIST PATHET LAO AND NEUTRALIST ARMY CHIEF KONG LE .THINGS SEEMED CHEERY ENOUGH AS THE OPPOSING LEADERS EMBRACED AND THEIRTROOPS EXCHANGED CIGARETTES . BUT, AS ONE NEUTRALIST PUT IT, " WEEXCHANGE CIGARETTES DURING THE DAY AND BULLETS AT NIGHT . " ALL TOOTRUE . HARDLY HAD SOUVANNA DEPARTED WHEN THE TRUCE ABRUPTLY COLLAPSED .NO ONE KNOWS WHO FIRED FIRST, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PATHET LAO WASSHOOTING, AND THE NEUTRALISTS WERE RUNNING . ON THE DUSTY PLAINE DESJARRES AIRSTRIP, MOTHERS BREASTFED DIRTY BABIES, AND CHILDREN SAGGEDUNDER THE WEIGHT OF PARACHUTE PACKS CRAMMED WITH HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGSAS THEY PATIENTLY WAITED FOR PLANES TO EVACUATE THEM TO THE LAOTIANCAPITAL OF VIENTIANE, 120 MILES AWAY . IN HIS RAMSHACKLE, TIN-ROOFEDHEADQUARTERS, GUARDED NIGHT AND DAY BY A PATROLLING PLATOON OF TANKS,KONG LE WORKED ROUND THE CLOCK DRAWING UP A BATTLE PLAN, ALTHOUGHWEAKENED BY A LIVER AILMENT AND A SERIOUS SINUS CONDITION . " THIS, "HE SAID, " IS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN . " MOVING OVER THE MOUNTAINTOPS ANDTHROUGH THE PASSES GIRDLING THE PLAIN, THE REDS AT LAST SURROUNDED THESIX-MILE-LONG PLATEAU . FROM THE HEIGHTS, THE COMMUNISTS LAID A MORTARBARRAGE ON THE AIRFIELD, KONG LE'S LAST REMAINING LIFELINE TO VIENTIANE. WITH THE AIRSTRIP INOPERABLE, KONG LE WAS FORCED TO RELY ON RUNNERSAS HIS PRIMARY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION ; HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULLTOGETHER WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS SHATTERED FORCES AND MOVE OFF THE PLAIN .PRESSURE FROM TWO QUARTERS . KONG LE'S RETREAT CAUSED CONSTERNATION INVIENTIANE . WITH HIS LEFT-RIGHT-CENTER COALITION FAST COMING UNSTUCK,PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA WAS FEARFUL THAT KONG LE'S TROOPS WOULD JOINFORCES WITH A RIGHT-WING ARMY JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE PLAINE DES JARRESAND LAUNCH A JOINT COUNTERATTACK AGAINST THE REDS THAT WOULD SURELYPRECIPITATE CIVIL WAR . DESPERATELY HE APPEALED TO BRITAIN AND RUSSIA,OVERSEERS OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, FOR QUICK INTERVENTION TO STOP THEPATHET LAO'S FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE CEASE-FIRE . RUSSIA HESITATEDTO INTERCEDE, FOR FEAR OF ALIENATING THE COMMUNISTS IN LAOS AND NORTHVIET NAM . SOVIET INTERVENTION AT THIS STAGE MIGHT TURN THEMINCREASINGLY TOWARD RED CHINA, RUSSIA'S RIVAL, FOR SUPPORT IN THEIRREVOLUTION . BUT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV WAS ALSO UNDER PRESSURE FROM ADIFFERENT QUARTER . IN WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT KENNEDY MADE IT CLEAR THATHE EXPECTED MOSCOW TO PUT A STOP TO PATHET LAO PRESSURE AND LIVE UP TOTHE GENEVA AGREEMENT . " WE WILL, I THINK, HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IN THENEXT FEW DAYS WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DESTRUCTION OF THAT ACCORDWHETHER THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER SIGNATORIES ARE GOING TO MEET THEIROBLIGATIONS, " SAID KENNEDY . TOUGHER U.S . ACTION COULD NOT BE RULEDOUT IF THE COMMUNISTS SHOWED SIGNS OF MOVING SOUTH FROM THE PLAINE DESJARRES INTO THE MEKONG RIVER VALLEY ITSELF . THIS WOULD STRENGTHENTHEIR SUPPLY ROUTES TO COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS FIGHTING IN NEIGHBORINGSOUTH VIET NAM, WHERE THE U.S . IS DEEPLY COMMITTED WITH BOTH MEN ANDMONEY . THOUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT DREADED THE THOUGHT OF ANY FURTHERMILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, OFFICIALS MADE IT CLEAR THATMORE TROOPS MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO THE AREA TO SAFEGUARD LAOTIANNEUTRALITY .
